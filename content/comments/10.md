body: "There but for the grace of god goes anyone’s kid.\\\n\nIf you are raising a child with mental health issues, God do you need a support system, primarily (yes, first) for you. \_My son is the same age as Ms. Long’s and is also violent. \_It is the hardest thing I have ever faced. \_I read her essay and thought, “This woman is crying out for help.” \_I never thought she exaggerated anything she said. \_My son has done the same things. \_Should she have written it in an open forum? \_No. But we act in response when we are overwhelmed and frightened of our own children. \_She not only needs support but the “right” kind” and what is NOT right is for a social worker to have advised her as he/she did. \_That’s not a support and the advice is wrong. \_She needs someone to accompany her who is aware of what her son is capable of doing but is also the voice of reason to help advise what is ridiculous. \_Yes, many residential treatment centers are horrible. \_I visited them when my son was in 6th short-term stay at a psych hospital. \_But you look harder because it’s clear that her son, like mine, cannot be safely maintained in an outpatient setting. \_The risk is way too high that someone is going to get hurt. \_Clearly she has shared with others, aside from the Social Worker , the level of violence and professionals (yes, that Social Worker) are mandated to report domestic abuse in the home when they hear about it. \_And the abuser can be a 13-year-old. \_She got bad advice and is not in the right frame of mine to weigh or seek other options or to realize that as bad as some of the residential centers are, at least he is not at the home where he can hurt her more than he has or hurt his siblings or hurt himself. \_she exposed and spoke about her son out of desperation. \_Enough reacted so I hope to God her son is not in the house, she is getting help for herself and that ultimately, a better place can be found for her son.\n"
