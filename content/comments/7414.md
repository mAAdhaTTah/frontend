  “Libertarianism, at least, forces power to be spread around instead of
  concentrated in a few hands.”


  This is the part of the Libertarian story that I just think is a fantasy. It
  seems like a great idea in theory, but reducing the size government and
  restricting the protections the law provides for those with the least power is
  not going help spread the power around. I have yet to hear a compelling case
  for that in theory.


  Women have always had the freedom to be stay-at-home moms, and I agree that
  other feminists shouldn’t deride your decision if that’s really what you
  prefer; I would just point out that it’s still far easier to be a SAHM than to
  try and have a career, and I think (and I’m putting words in their mouths)
  feminists are concerned that those who choose not to work are succumbing to
  social pressures while denying the impact those pressures have on their
  decision. Which ultimately shouldn’t be an attack on a SAHM anyway, but on
  those pressures that push women from a career back into the home. I haven’t
  read anything attacking SAHMs recently, so I don’t know how it this manifests
  itself, but those opportunities should be used as a chance to make a larger
  point than attack to individual women for their choices.


  The abortion issue is really the contentious one, but I’ve always been of the
  mind that if you think abortion is murder, than don’t have an abortion. If
  you’re advocating for the banning of abortion, than you’re denying the someone
  the right to come to that conclusion on their own. And while I’ve always
  understood why conservatism generally on takes that issue, given its
  relationship with the right-wing culture warriors, it always seemed like a
  given to me that libertarianism would be pro-choice. From a feminist
  perspective, you’re absolutely reducing the right of women to make their own
  choice, so if you advocate for making abortions illegal, then it would follow
  that feminists wouldn’t welcome you into their ranks.


  But your overall point is valid, and quite frankly, is a far more interesting
  debate than what the author wrote about. There are some serious and
  interesting questions about how prescriptive feminism is and whether choosing
  to be a part of conservative cultural traditions is acceptable to feminist
  orthodoxy, and you brought up a good example in the SAHM question. I was just
  frustrated that the author took on the most boring and most polarizing ones.
