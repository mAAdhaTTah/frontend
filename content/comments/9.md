body: "Thanks for a rational, thoughtful position on this chain of posts and comments.\_ I network extensively with fellow moms of special needs kids, and there has long been a running conversation about whether to encourage people outside our “community” to join our conversations.\_ This is because there is so much emotional blood-letting mixed in with talk of diagnoses, diet regimes, neuro-atypical challenges, our OWN mental health as mothers, and our occasional anger at parents of Textbook Kids when they complain about what to us seems microscopic.\_ I’m not rubber-stamping all of Liza’s blog or approach.\_ But I do think she is sincere in struggling, in reaching out for help, and in trying to shine light on something many haven’t a clue about.\n"
