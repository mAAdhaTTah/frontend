  Very good post. I do have to say, I think you are both right and wrong when
  you say "But this isn't about gun control. This is about a much, MUCH
  less-often talked about issue: mental health." (Unless you mean "This blog
  post" by "this, rather than "The event on friday". If thats the case, my
  bad, disregard the rest of the comment.Thse events are about mental health and
  how its handled in this country. But I also think it IS about gun laws and gun
  safety as well. I'd argue what we just saw on friday (and the theater
  shooting, and the fort hood shooting, and every mass shooting we've seen) are
  the results of multiple issues, none of which are really getiing any serious
  action or discussion.
