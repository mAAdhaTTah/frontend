body: "Very good post. I do have to say, I think you are both right and wrong when you say “But this isn\x92t about gun control. This is about a much, MUCH less-often talked about issue: mental health.” (Unless you mean “This blog post” by “this, rather than “The event on friday”.\_ If thats the case, my bad, disregard the rest of the comment.I think you are spot on when you say thse events are about mental health and how its handled in this country. But I also think it IS about gun laws and gun safety as well. I’d argue what we just saw on friday (and the theater shooting, and the fort hood shooting, and every mass shooting we’ve seen) are the results of multiple issues, none of which are really getiing any serious action or discussion.\n"
