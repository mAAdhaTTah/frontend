  Yes, they are. I’m not inclined to worry about performance until it’s an
  issue, but there have been discussions / worries about the overhead of
  creating that many closures. The inline arrow functions can be optimized away,
  e.g.:


  ```js

  ```


  won’t incur any overhead of the inline arrows because the compiler can
  optimize them away. In fact, the Babel plugin itself currently does.
