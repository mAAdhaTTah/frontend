  Yeah – I felt more as though your post was reacting to the either-or mentality
  than promulgating it.  And we are NO KIDDING way to far on the non-creative
  side and definitely need to push back against it.  And, yes, it really comes
  down to implementation.  I guess my point is that the things that \_can\_ make
  a difference within the system are probably necessarily going to be things
  that can be used to promote the status quo although with the seeds and
  potential for change within them.  I love those seeds … I hope we can nurture
  them.  In the case of common core, I am overall positive on the standards
  themselves – it’s the assessment part where I am hoping against hope for
  someone to do something brilliant!
