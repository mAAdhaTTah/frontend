  I agree with the first part, and I don’t mean to imply I’m taking an either/or
  approach to the Common Core – just trying to push back on something that I
  think has gone too far in the opposite directions.  It’s never as simple as
  one of the other, but I do think it’s gone too far in the “uncreative”
  direction and it’s time we shifted back.


  I also would mention that I don’t really have a strong view on the efficacy of
  the Common Core as whole, or whether it makes sense to have a nationalized
  curriculum at all.  It’s something I’ve read quite a bit about, but I don’t
  really know where to fall just yet.


  I do have some disagreements with points 2 and 4 in support of CCSS, although
  I suppose those have a lot to do with implementation rather than the nature of
  CCSS.  I am just concerned that national standards will actually reduce the
  amount of experimentation that takes place on the local level.  But being able
  to build a tool locally and scale it nationally is a huge benefit.
