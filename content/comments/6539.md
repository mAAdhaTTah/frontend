  Aram Zucker-Scharff: One with a lot of pieces between the edge and center.


  James DiGioia: That you don’t know what they look like, or someone else has
  cut those pieces for you, but you don’t know where they fit, or they kinda
  fit, but not exactly, so you take their pieces and cut them yourself to make
  them fit, and your versions fit with some pieces well but not others, so you
  have to get them all these new pieces to fit together while keeping all the
  pieces that already fit together still fitting.


  In your head.


  James DiGioia: And every time you think you’ve completed the puzzle, you
  realize the last piece you need doesn’t actually fit anywhere and you have to
  break up huge sections and start over just to make that one piece fit.


  Adam Birnbaüm: It’s never complete. You’re never playing with all the pieces.
