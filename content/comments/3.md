  I think that perhaps the saddest outcome of the common core standards debate
  is this intellectual flight to “either-or” scenarios.  Either our kids will be
  able to pass the SAT OR they will be creative.  Either we nurture an educated
  citizenry OR one that is prepared for compliance-based jobs.  Either we ignore
  improving education anywhere until we solve poverty OR we hold those who teach
  poor children “accountable” for wringing test scores out of students who are
  hungry and/or frightened.


  There is plenty of room for innovation on many levels to address different
  “problems” in education.  If we are looking for personalization, we have to
  recognize \_anything\_ that moves the ball forward – I would argue, even if it
  is happening for the wrong reason.


  Now suppose that the reason the Common Core exists is to increase
  compliance-based learning, reduce creativity, and minimize the cost to giant
  profit-mongering publishers of producing content to the whole United States. 
  That would not alter the fact that opportunities created include:\

  – A more level playing field for innovative start-ups or universities or
  educators who otherwise could NEVER compete with the aforesaid giant
  profit-mongering publishers, leading to:\

  – More and different experiments with the best ways for different students to,
  as quickly and easily as possible, achieve compliance, leading to:\

  – More time in the day, for some, at least, (assuming even marginally
  reasonable competency-models become legal) to spend time in inquiry-based,
  student-centered, authentic, interest-based, and/or studio/atelier-based
  learning, leading to:\

  – More research and experience regarding what supports the whole student in
  realizing his or her potential and his or her goals


  A two-edged sword?  Certainly.  Balanced in the wrong direction?  Perhaps. 
  But also an enabler, one of many, that shift the needle on transformation from
  “impossible” to “improbable”.  We should celebrate every one and lead by
  example when it comes to using them wisely and well.
