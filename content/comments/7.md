  @Bookgal1977 Hah, yes, I did mean the blog post.  I do think gun control is a
  major issue, but it’s something that people already have a strong opinion on,
  whereas mental health issues is something people talk about a lot less often. 
  Mental health became a much bigger issue after this shooting (less so after
  Aurora), but in the larger context of ongoing discussions, I felt it’s really
  not tackled as often.
