  You make some good points, but those in control when the government is
  providing redress are still those in control. Libertarianism, at least, forces
  power to be spread around instead of concentrated in a few hands.&#x20;


  In the end, if feminists depend on the government to ensure they are made more
  equal, they are still depending on someone outside themselves and their own
  organizations. And government can be just as much a tool of oppression as it
  can be of leveling the playing field. It is a deal with the devil.


  BTW, conservative feminists are not fighting for FEWER freedoms for women, but
  rather more (or perhaps different ones). We want the freedom, among other
  things, to be stay-at-home moms without criticism if we so choose, and to not
  depend on the government for things like birth control, and to not be expected
  to agree with abortion in order to call ourselves feminists. It would also be
  really nice if our conservative feminist leaders stopped getting threatened
  with hate-f\*\*\* and stuff like that.&#x20;


  Really, it would just be nice if everyone would stop shouting and assuming
  they know what the other side REALLY believes â€“ and instead tried, you know,
  having some discussions. Like dating, just got to know one another, you know?
