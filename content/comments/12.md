  I’m personally inclined to think the inclusion of those who doesn’t
  necessarily experience those types of problems on a day-to-day basis is really
  the best way to help them understand what you go through.  Obviously, some
  people are inclined to be critical regardless, and there’s no reason to keep
  that kind of negativity around.  However, I just have to imagine that there
  are plenty of people who just don’t know any better and would benefit greatly
  by hearing what that’s like from your perspective.


  Not sure if your “network” is anything official, but feel free to post a
  follow-up comment with a link to your website if you have one.
