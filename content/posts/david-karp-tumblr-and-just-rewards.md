      Jumping off of [Monday's
      post](https://jamesdigioia.com/tumblr-and-yahoo-everyones-rich-and-everyone-loses/
      "Is Getting Rich Off Ideas a Bad Thing?") about Tumblr and David Karp,
      I've been thinking about what it means to deserve rewards for your work.


      If I'm interpreting correctly, [Biddle basically is
      arguing](http://valleywag.gawker.com/tumblr-and-yahoo-everyones-rich-and-everyone-loses-508883301
      "Tumblr and Yahoo: Everyone's Rich and Everyone Loses") that Karp doesn't
      deserve this kind of payout, that it "sets a bad precedent" for those who
      pursue businesses with no financial goals. I posted yesterday that I
      thought that was a problematic position to take.


      On Twitter, I referenced the research university as an example of society
      being willing to pay for/reward work that doesn't necessarily provide
      economic value, to which I was told "well yeah, but those could change the
      world. Tumblr... not so much."


      My counterpart imposes his own values upon Tumblr: is it worth anything?
      Has it changed the world? Has it improved anything? Or is it just a vast
      wasteland of GIFs, porn, and celebrity gossip?


      I think this is the wrong question to ask. The more interesting question
      is whether it is acceptable for a company with no economic value\[1.
      Insofar as it generates little/no revenue] should be purchased for the
      staggering $1.1 billion Tumblr was purchased for.


      Society rewards effort and hard work with... money. Wealth. And the power
      that comes with it. And that effort and hard work is measured by its
      economic value: how much economic activity does it generate, how much
      money does it make, how many products does it sell, etc.


      From this perspective, it makes little sense, when you are buying into
      this "monetary-rewards" system by starting a company, to then be rewarded
      within that system for intentionally not living up to the standards it
      sets. David Karp eschewed any aim of making money with Tumblr (and
      ironically enough, [previously proclaimed his desire not to sell at
      all](http://www.mediabistro.com/So-What-Do-You-Do-David-Karp-Founder-of-Tumblr-a10281.html
      "So What Do You Do, David Karp, Founder of Tumblr?")).


      However, there's also a lot of activities (I'll point to the obvious
      non-profit work to avoid deluding my point) that generate social value
      without being rewarded with money. Again, these are ideas and activities
      with a much more murky sense of their social value, as the accomplishments
      aren't as easily measurable; to be more explicit with an example, if you
      run a soup kitchen and feed 100 people every day, how would one decide
      whether that activity is more socially valuable than a small business
      owner? There is no easy, direct comparison the way economic activity is an
      easy, direct comparison.


      What I'm trying to get at is society doesn't really do a good job of
      rewarding activities that benefit it without any direct economic activity
      generated\[2. I would also argue, within the monetary rewards system, we
      do a poor job providing proper rewards for even economic activities, but
      that's for another day.]. Non-profit work is notoriously difficult and
      undervalued, and many organizations that do good work struggle to keep the
      lights on. As a general principle, I don't think it's unreasonable to
      reward an idea, and its execution, that proves immensely useful and
      popular the way Tumblr was, even if it doesn't generate any direct
      economic activity.


      However, I think Biddle's real problem is that Karp never fully committed
      to one side or the other; if he really wanted to pursue Tumblr as an "art
      project," insofar as it was dedicated solely to his particular vision of
      the product and refuse any attempts to subvert that vision for profits,
      there are numerous ways for him to have organized it to those ends\[3.
      Although I am inclined to think none of these would have granted Tumblr
      the size, scale, and impact it ultimately achieved.].


      However, he did choose to organize it as a company, and he did take on
      investors, and those investors did so with the belief that this investment
      would be profitable, that the company they were investing in would be
      profitable and by extension, make them money.


      So his approach to Tumblr as a company ultimately allowed him to straddle
      those two divides and reap the benefits of both, by both having full
      control while making a lot of money, without being subjected to the
      difficulties of either, by either struggling financially as artists do or
      subjecting their vision to the needs of a profit-making entity.


      He didn't end up having to make the hard choices -- the choices adults
      have to make when values and needs conflict. And ultimately, he has a real
      problem with society rewarding Karp without forcing him to make the tough
      choices society asks of us in return.


      That's the bad precedent the Tumblr sale sets.

  Sam Biddle has some interesting things to say about David Karp’s aversion to
  making boatloads of money while making a boatload of money: you can’t have it
  both ways.
