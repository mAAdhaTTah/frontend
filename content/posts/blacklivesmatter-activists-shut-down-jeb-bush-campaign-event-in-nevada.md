      "IF ONLY WE WE ALL NICER TO EACH OTHER!" -- Jeb Bush

      <ExtendedQuote>
        “When my son steps out every day, I don’t know if he’s gonna step back in because of racial tension,” one woman says, before asking, “How do you relate to that?”

        “I relate to it by, as president, trying to create a society where there is civility and understanding,” Bush responds. “And to encourage mayors, leaders at the local level, to engage so that there’s not despair and isolation in communities.”
