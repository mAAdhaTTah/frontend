      When people talk about racism, they spend a lot of time pointing out all
      the ways it no longer exists in overt ways. On the ground level, though,
      there's still a lot ambiguity, and I think the ["gaslighting" metaphor
      here is
      apt](http://gawker.com/kanye-west-knows-you-think-he-sounded-nuts-on-kimmel-1443710553):

        There's a form of mental torture called "gaslighting," its name taken from a play in which a man convinces his wife that the gas lights in their home she sees brightening and dimming are, in fact, maintaining a steady glow. His ultimate goal is to drive his her into a mental institution and take all her money, and soon the woman ends up in an argument with herself about whether she's losing her mind. American race relations have a similar narrative: An entire set of minorities confident that the everyday slights they're seeing are real and hurtful, and an entire set of other people assuring them that they're wrong.

      Kanye's experience in the fashion industry becomes a large-scale example
      of that:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        The BBC interview was personal and honest and heartfelt, but it was also frenetic and boastful and rambling at times–perfect fodder for late night TV, in other words. Kimmel mocked it by reproducing the interview with a black kid in place of West. When West took offense, and let loose a series of furious tweets, Kimmel gave the smirk of a comedian who couldn't see the big deal. You know the one; it climbs up only one side of the face, its meaning being: It was just a joke. That Kanye West didn't take it as a joke isn't really a surprise, even if we ignore the fact that he's famously self-serious. Here he'd done an interview explaining how hurtful it is to have proved one's ability and still be seen as inferior by rich white people, and a rich white person responded by infantilizing him.

      It becomes really easy to dismiss a situation like this when it's
      ambiguous, and you can dismiss a lot of small slights like this because
      you don't know, but they all add up, and instead of confronting repeated
      incidents of racism as what they are, we label minorities as "sensitive."


      The term "gaslighting" is quite accurate.
