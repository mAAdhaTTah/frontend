  - content: "<ExtendedQuote>\n  When Google declared war on RSS and the open web by killing off their reader it was a heavy blow for deep thinking and for blogging. At first, I didn\x92t miss it. I still had twitter after all. But over time, I began to realize that relying on twitter only for what I was going to read and learn was like relying on the remote control of my TV. It put me too much at the whim of other people and things I just happened to see. I had a great form of synchronous communication, but I had lost the intentionality of using asynchronous tools.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nEvery once in a while, I consider dropping my RSS reader in favor of Twitter all the time. This article sums up why I don't.\n"
