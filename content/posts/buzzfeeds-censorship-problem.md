      I mean this question both sarcastically and seriously: Is this really new?
      As if advertisers have never tried to pressure news organizations to kill
      a story. As if they've never succeeded. As if journalism used to live in a
      glorious past where all was objectivity and editorial independence and
      this young upstart is heralding a new "era of brand driven censorship."


      Admittedly, I don't know my history, which is why this is partially a
      serious question, but my spidey senses are tingling...
