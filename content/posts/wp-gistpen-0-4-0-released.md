      I *finally* published version 0.4.0 of WP-Gistpen late last night. I'm
      still figuring out the WP.org deployment process, so there continues to be
      short hiccups with README updating. Really annoying.


      However, the MAJOR new feature of this release is the ability to include
      multiple Files in each Gistpen, similar to Gist. WP-Gistpen isn't exactly
      like Gist just yet, but that addition makes it close enough where anyone
      can begin moving off of Gist. Eventually, you'll be able to migrate your
      Gists into Gistpen and migration will be really easy.


      The other major feature is the ACE editor, which is more effective for
      code than the TinyMCE editor WordPress ships with. The back-end has been
      restructured to support all of this, unit tests have been written for
      everything, and we have a very good foundation for future Gistpen
      development.


      Check out the latest WP-Gistpen on
      [Github](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/WP-Gistpen) or on the
      [WordPress.org repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gistpen/) and
      let me know how it works for you.
