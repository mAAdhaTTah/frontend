      Why worry about the growing dominance of such digitalism? The reason
      should be obvious. As Internet-driven explanations crowd out everything
      else, our entire vocabulary is being re-defined. Collaboration is
      re-interpreted through the prism of Wikipedia; communication, through the
      prism of social networking; democratic participation, through the prism of
      crowd-sourcing; cosmopolitanism, through the prism of reading the blogs of
      exotic "others"; political upheaval, through the prism of the so-called
      Twitter revolutions.
