The professionals collected tips, corroborated them, published the ones that panned out. Reporters could protect their readers from bad information \x97 indeed, for reporters, the story was defined largely by what was kept from the public; for readers, the story was defined by the story. But now we should assume our readers and viewers see virtually everything that we see. We can no longer decide which rumors and scraps of information should be dignified with publication \x97 a sufficiently compelling scrap of information, be it a picture of a man with a black backpack or an anonymous, single-sentence Reddit post from the scene of the crime, will become news on that merit alone.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nInteresting change in the way the media tells the story -- less about presenting facts and more about narrative.\n"
