      What happens to affective teaching labor when it runs up against robots,
      against automation? Even the tasks that education technology purports to
      now be able to automate – teaching, testing, grading – are shot through
      with emotion when done by humans, or at least when done by a person who’s
      supposed to have a caring, supportive relationship with their students.
      Grading essays isn’t necessarily burdensome because it’s menial, for
      example; grading essays is burdensome because it is affective labor; it is
      emotionally and intellectually exhausting.
