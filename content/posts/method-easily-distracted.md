      This is too good to summarize, so I'll just pull this quote from [Timothy
      Burke's "The
      Method"](http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/blog/2013/08/23/the-method/)
      and tell you to go read it:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        But if the federal government wants that outcome or we want that outcome, then figure out an answer to the question, 'So why do students and their families actually pay so much for a bad service?' The answer is a little bit, 'Because there's not enough information out there to make a good choice' and a lot, 'Because they have to.' Why do they have to? Because there are too many people chasing too few jobs, and because employers are using credentials as a proxy for, 'People who want the jobs bad enough that they might do the job well'. The more people that get the credentials, the more that people looking for a proxy that makes a more and more arbitrary process of selecting a candidate manageable look for more credentials. Which turns higher education into a kind of death march of debt and dysfunctionally pegs its content to whatever concretized credentials desperate middle managers think they need for jobs that really just take common sense, critical thought, energy and the ability to communicate.
