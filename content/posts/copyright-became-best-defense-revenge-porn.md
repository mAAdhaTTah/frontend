      This is interesting. Is it possible to weaken copyright law without losing
      a tool like this? Should copyright be used as a tool in this way? How
      often does this happen? A better solution is provide real legal
      protections for revenge porn, but as a practical matter, both won't come
      about together, so what's takes priority?
