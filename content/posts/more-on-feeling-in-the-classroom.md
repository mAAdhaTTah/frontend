  - content: "[This justification](http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2013/03/feel-want-willing.html \"Feel Want Willing\") of \"feeling\" in the classroom from [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/ \"Stephen's Web\") continues to piggy-back off [previous](https://jamesdigioia.com/a-neuroscientific-justification-for-fiction-in-the-classroom/ \"A Neuroscientific Justification for Fiction in the Classroom\")\_[posts](https://jamesdigioia.com/content-vs-reflection-in-the-common-core-standards/ \"Content vs. Reflection in the Common Core Standards\") on fiction:\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  The first stage isn't empty. It tells the other person how the problem is affecting you, developing a sense of urgency and empathy. The idea is that if the other person sees the consequence of the problem, and not just the symptoms, they can respond with something that solves the underlying issue, and not just the symptoms. Why is this important? If you skip the first stage -- or can't express what it is that really bothers you about something -- your communications with others become just a repeated set of \"I want I want\" statements. The other person, if they care what you want at all, tries one after another band-aid solution without ever solving the problem.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nOne of the things that concerns me is using economic arguments to bolster what I feel are moral imperatives, but it is definitely an aspect of this I hadn't considered.\n\nGo read his piece -- it's quite interesting.\n"
