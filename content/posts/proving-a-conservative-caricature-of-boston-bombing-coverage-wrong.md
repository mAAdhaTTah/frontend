The conservative press has done very little reporting. Its been busy cherry-picking liberal dissents from the jihadist theory of the Boston bombing, treating those dissents as if they\x92re representative of \x93the liberal media\x94 generally, and needlessly worrying about a supposed unwillingness to confront radical Islam. \x93The chances are that we will learn nothing important from Boston about the enduring terrorist threat against our country,\x94 Rich Lowry writes. \x93When the next attack comes, and it will, we will again scratch our heads and wonder who could do such a thing, and why?\x94 I think he\x92s been reading too much Steyn, and that when the next attack comes, the mainstream media will thoroughly report on the people behind it too.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nSurprise, surprise -- conservatives live in a bubble.\n"
