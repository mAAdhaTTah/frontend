        "While we believe that this transaction is, and will be determined to be, pro-competitive, pro-consumer, and strongly in the public interest when we make our case and seek approval from federal regulators, we recognize that certain competitive concerns might be raised about consolidation of these assets under one roof," Comcast said in a fact sheet. "But we strongly believe that these competitive concerns are already addressed, not only by the highly competitive marketplace in which the new company will vigorously compete for subscribers, but also by existing rules and regulations."

      Do the people who write these press releases actually believe this stuff?
