      Anti-Capitalism-Capitalism"](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/05/21/silicon-valleys-anti-capitalism-capitalism/):

        This may be an example of a larger trend towards a capitalism that doesn't exist in spite of, doesn't merely appropriate, but exists and even thrives precisely because of its anti-capitalist base. This isn't exactly like how, say, punk so quickly got sold back to us by capitalists, or how capitalists have slapped Che's face on t-shirts sold at Urban Outfitters, but instead a type of capitalism that is predicated, knowingly or unknowingly, on the idea of anti-capitalism. It's not a capitalist logic that can co-opt anti-capitalism, but capitalism where anti-capitalism is an inherent part of its logic. Said differently, Silicon Valley's habit of acting outside or above capitalism as an essential part of their business model is the essence of anti-capitalism-capitalism.

      Another interesting response to that Sam Biddle piece I previously
      [engaged with
      here](https://jamesdigioia.com/david-karp-tumblr-and-just-rewards/ "David
      Karp, Tumblr, and Just Rewards"). Nathan takes a look at it from a
      different angle, focusing on how Silicon Valley's ethos fits into the
      larger economic structure of capitalism.
