      I'll be honest, before I knew any better, I belonged to the "John Roberts
      School of Fighting Racism": "The best way to stop discriminating based on
      race is to stop discriminating based on race." However, it's the outcomes
      of these policies (and personal practices) that's often discriminatory. We
      can't simply ignore it and expect it to go away on its own.
