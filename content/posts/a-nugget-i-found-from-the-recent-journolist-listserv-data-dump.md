      [Ryan Donmoyer from the "Journolist
      Listserv"](http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/716753/journolist.txt):


      <ExtendedQuote>
        The World Cup is a lot like the Senate. All they do is kick the ball around but nothing ever happens and no one who watches knows what the hell is going on.
      </ExtendedQuote>


      To be fair, I can't be sure these are his words or if he's quoting
      someone.


      Update: Ryan Donmoyer contacted me on Twitter about it and was kind enough
      to search for the original thread. This quote cannot be attributed to him:
