      This is a great explanation of the upcoming Supreme Court case on Internet
      free speech. I'll just add I've read elsewhere that SCOTUS is unlikely to
      make this ruling as sweeping as people seem to fear they will. Whether
      "punting" like that is for good or ill remains to be seen.
