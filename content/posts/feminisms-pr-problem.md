      In retrospect, this comment, made on a Facebook post, is really
      presumptuous, as if I *know* what the problems are and others don't, and
      I'm going to cop to that from the outset. However, in this case, my
      audience was a couple of guys<FootnoteReference id="1" />, and thus, based
      on my reading of the situation, did know less than I did. I hope in that
      context, this doesn't sound so bad.


      In any, I do want to save this here because it's also an argument I've had
      a few times with people, and I do think there's a lot of really important,
      under-discussed work being done by those "on the front line." Take that
      for what you will.

        I think one of the biggest PR problems "feminism" has is that people think of white feminism as "feminism." And it's not. Movements like "Ban Bossy" and the whole Lean In movement are pretty much designed to appeal to white, middle class, feminist women, but defining feminism as that particular subset of work is confining and overly simplifying and leaves out all the incredible and important work being done by WoC in addressing both the racial gap that exists inside feminism as well as how racism and sexism overlap and impact society at large.

        A lot of that work is also aimed at diversifying our understanding of gender and moving away from viewing it as a binary. Not that feminism co-opts the LGBTQ movement, but their work frequently overlaps in important ways. As well as the inequality issue. And there's work being done within those groups to expand the philosophy and connect all these ideas together.<FootnoteReference id="2" />

        And that's just in the West. I know pretty much nothing about work abroad, but if that work gets as little media play as the work I mentioned, then it must be happening, although it doesn't get the support and coverage it needs.

        Because of the way society is, you mostly hear about the much much smaller subset of white feminism, and while I'm mostly on their side when it comes to particular issues, I have no doubts that their priorities are often misplaced. But that's not all feminism is, that's just what you hear about because our Western media privileges white people, and that happens even within equality movements.

        I bring this up mostly because I hear people dismiss feminism for being shallow often, and I don't want to lose the baby with the bathwater, especially because a lot of this work is being especially vital. I just want to ask why we think, with all this other important stuff going on, the things you hear in the media are mostly those that make feminism look bad.

        This is actually specifically a reference to [this article](http://thefeministwire.com/2014/05/alert-capital-intersectional-radicalizing-pikettys-inequality/) about Thomas Piketty's "Capital" and its connection to gendered labor and racial inequality. Additionally, there's [this article in The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/blog/180895/how-gender-changes-pikettys-capital-twenty-first-century) I found (but haven't yet read) while searching for the first.
