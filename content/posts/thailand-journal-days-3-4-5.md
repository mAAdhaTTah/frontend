      *tl;dr version: We went to Koh Samed and spent 3 days (one of them
      Christmas) drinking Mai Tais on the beach.*


      Fortunately for us, the bus station to Koh Samed was located near the
      Skytrain, right off the Ekkamai stop. You can see the bus station from the
      train. As we approached the station, we were greeted by several drivers,
      the last of which was a taxi driver who, after being told we were taking
      the bus, showed us to the correct window. The Thais are consistently the
      friendliest and most helpful people I've ever met.


      We took the bus to Ban Phe, which has a ferry to Koh Samed, and we
      purchased both at the same time. If you're going to Koh Samed, look at
      what beach you're staying on; some beaches have direct ferries from the
      pier, rather than taking the long route we did. It may even be cheaper.
      The bus provided water and snacks for the ride, which was pretty awesome.
      You don't find service like that in the US :).


      The bus ride itself was interesting. I would definitely recommend to
      anyone who goes to Thailand to take a least one trip out of the city. The
      countryside is absolutely fascinating. Bangkok itself and Thailand as a
      whole is a combination of old Third World-y housing and Western
      development. Simply staring out the window during the bus ride was
      enthralling. I wish I had taken pictures, sorry.


      Along the bus route, we stopped a number of times to drop people off on
      the side of the road; not at a bus station or at anything organized, but
      just in random locations in random towns. I guess they give rides to
      people who need them.


      We arrived in Ban Phe and crossed the road to the pier. Before we got on
      the ferry, there was a window we had to stop at. There's a 200 Baht per
      person fee to enter Koh Samed, which is a national park. We almost thought
      it was a scam, but fortunately, there were other Americans with us who
      knew about the fee in advance.


      Getting on the ferry, like most things, was interesting; they don't really
      provide any safety or anything, or even a ramp to walk on. They just kind
      stick a plank off the dock into a window and you just hop through. I was
      pretty sure I was going to fall in the ocean, with my huge backpack on my
      back, but I made it, and we went to the island.


      The trip across was beautiful, and we shot the breeze a bit with the
      American couple with us before we landed. Once we got there, we were
      supposed to take a "taxi" to our resort, but the taxi was basically just a
      pickup truck with seats in the bed, and we had to drive over dirt roads
      with lots of potholes to get to our resort. I held on tight.


      We got to the resort and checked in, and we were blown away by the view
      from our cabana. The cabana itself was just a bedroom and bathroom, but we
      did have a porch, upon which sat a little black cat, who was very
      friendly. We unpacked, played with him a bit, and then went off to eat an
      early dinner before getting some dusk swimming in. The water was warm and
      very salty, and I spent a lot of the vacation just floating on my back.


      That was Christmas, don't forget, and that evening was spent lounging in a
      beach chair, drinking Mai Tais on the beach as we watched Chinese Lanterns
      float off into the distance.


      The next day was pretty much spent swimming and eating. There are a number
      of people walking up and down the beach, selling fruit, water, margaritas,
      and chicken. It was interesting, though, because the bars along the beach
      don't shoo them away or ask them to leave. In fact, one person wanted to
      order chicken from the bar, and they actually told him to buy food from
      the beach guys (they didn't have chicken at the bar).


      For dinner, every restaurant buys from the day's catch, and they lay it
      out on ice on a big table on the beach. You go up to the table, point to
      what you want, and they grill it up for you right there. The restaurant we
      went to also have these tables without seats, exactly -- the table was in
      the center, with a fully wrapped around bench (if that makes sense), will
      pillows that allow you to lay next to the table, rather than sit in front
      of it.


      The end of the excursion was uneventful -- we swam in the morning, ate
      breakfast, took the jeep-taxi back to the ferry, and returned home on bus
      that took us out. I did stop and pick up the white hat you see below in
      the market by the bus station. They do have a lot of weird snacks --
      mostly dried seafood. Once home, we relaxed and shared a few Facebook
      posts before retiring to bed.
