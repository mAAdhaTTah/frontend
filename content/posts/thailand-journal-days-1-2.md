      *tl;dr version: We spent our first 2 days in Bangkok, eating food and
      visiting the Jim Thompson House.*


      ## Day 1


      Despite having vowed not to sleep past noon, we awoke the next day around
      1:30 or so. Right as we climbed out of bed, we heard someone trying to
      enter the apartment with keys. Assuming it was the maid, I cracked the
      door a bit, and I was greeted by an affable British fellow. Steven, one of
      Robert's fiends, was stopping by to drop off milk and fruit for us. I put
      some clothes on, introduced myself, and thanked him for the food. Black
      coffee suits no one.


      We moved slowly that morning, expecting to mostly get out for dinner and
      take in a bit of the city, leaving more of the sightseeing to later in the
      week. Robert has an odd coffee machine, called Le Cube, similar to the
      Keurig machines you see in the US, but for making espresso. It was
      surprisingly good.


      We eventually got out of the apartment and headed down to the pier.
      Bangkok, unlike New York, uses its main river, Chao Praya, as a
      significant thoroughfare for transportation. All the hotels on the river
      charter boats guests can use to help get around the city. Additionally,
      there are a number of smaller boats which act like water taxis, which you
      hail from a pier to take you where you want to go. It's a decent system
      for transportation, though it does make the river quite crowded; throw in
      some river cruises and a few barges, and it's a wonder boats aren't
      colliding left and right.


      Baan Chao Praya, the apartment building we're staying at, charters its own
      boat as well, and we got our first look at the city. It was surprising how
      many of the buildings along the water were poor, given the typically high
      value placed on waterfront property. It appears that a lot of the houses
      are built out of aluminum siding, and a number of them seem precarious as
      they rest along the riverbanks. The past year had experienced a
      significantly higher amount of flooding, which may account for the
      precariousness of their situation. The fact that some of the houses were
      even allowed to be lived in at all was surprising.


      The boat took us to Saphon Taksin, a major pier for commuter boats, as
      well as an interchange with the Skytrain. The disembarking process was
      little more than sidling up to the pier and hopping off while the pilot
      revved the engine just enough to keep the boat pressed against the dock.
      It didn't look like any of the locals ever had a problem with this, but I
      did see one French guy look perturbed when the driver told him to jump
      out.


      The Skytrain is a fairly new and really beautiful public transport system.
      It unfortunately covers a fairly small portion of the city and doesn't go
      anywhere near the Old City, where all the temples are. However, it is very
      easy to navigate and very cheap.


      We took the Skytrain one stop to Surasak, looking for a restaurant that
      Robert had recommended called Taling Kling. The first street we wandered
      up was the wrong one, but we did come across an Indian temple, where we
      made Tourist Mistake #1: don't stop to read the info signs. Immediately
      upon doing so, we were approached by a man with no front teeth, who
      started by actually giving us some useful information: during some yearly
      celebration near the temple, the entire street is blocked off to cars and
      thousands of people come out for what sounded like a giant party.


      He then asked us where we were going, and we mentioned the restaurant. A
      nice Thai woman overheard us and provided directions in pretty good
      English. We thanked her, and as we walked away, I commented that I was
      surprised we didn't get a pitch from the toothless man.


      But I spoke too soon. The man chased us down in his tuk-tuk and hopped
      out, showing us a map of where we were and where he could take us. "20
      Baht, 1 hour." We said no thanks, and he was kind enough to leave us alone
      fairly quickly.


      Two things about this I'll mention: first, while people will try to sell
      you things constantly (taxi rides, clothes, jewelry, paintings), they're
      pretty good about leaving you alone once you say no. The second thing (and
      this slightly contradicts the first) is we were told that this is a fairly
      common scam in Bangkok. A driver will take you on a tour for really cheap,
      and at the end of the tour, you'll end up at a shop (I was told typically
      a jewelry store) where you'll be pressured into buying some gems or other
      worthless stones, with the driver getting a cut. I think the quick "no"
      leads them to seek easier targets who may seem intrigued and thus more
      likely to buy stuff at the end as well.


      The Thai woman's directions led us to the restaurant, where we had our
      first sampling of local Thai food, as well as our first insight into how
      cheap this country can be: we went a little crazy, with 2 apps, 2 mains,
      and a dessert, as well as a few drinks plus water (which you have to pay
      for, because it's all bottled), and it came out to 1,500 Baht, or $50 at
      the current exchange rate. We ate a number of meals for 2 people, with
      drinks, at restaurants, for under $10 (300 Baht), and the street food can
      provide a decent meal for 60-100 Baht.


      We returned the way we came, but not before stopping at 7-11. Yes, they
      have those here, and they are EVERYWHERE (at Koh Samed, there were two of
      them across from each other just off the dock). It's a bit of a cultural
      uncanny valley-esque experience. They have the same look and layout as an
      American one, complete with a Slurpee machine, but everything is in Thai
      (obviously) and the snacks for sale are very different -- a lot of things
      are seafood-based, with crab and crawfish snacks, plus incense and an
      entire row dedicated to varieties of ramen noodles. We got some ramen and
      some yogurt and headed home.


      ## Day 2


      I slept fitfully, waking up everything two hours or so, while Heidi didn't
      sleep at all. Being 12 hours off from your normal sleeping times will do
      at to you. It did provide the opportunity to take some great photos of the
      sunrise over Bangkok from Robert's balcony.


      We continued to move slowly, eventually getting out of the apartment
      around 9 or so. We took the boat to Saphon Taksin and rode to the end of
      the line, National Stadium. The Skytrain there connects to MBK, which is
      basically a mall of sorts, but not quite the same as malls you see in the
      States.


      We went mostly for food, and on the fifth floor, they had a massive
      cafeteria-style setup called Fifth Avenue. Upon entering, you get a swipe
      card which you can use to buy food from a wide variety of stations,
      serving food from all over the world: Thai (obviously), Greek, Italian,
      Middle Eastern, Indian, Chinese, etc. It's really a bit overwhelming, and
      I was still out of it, between the jet lag and the shock of being in
      another country.


      After eating, we wandered around the mall a bit, checking the prices for
      things and deciding what we'd want to take a look at when we returned. We
      decided to hold off shopping until the end of the trip, for budgetary
      reasons, but it looks like a lot of things will be quite cheaper here.


      We then headed over to the Jim Thompson House, for our sightseeing of the
      day. Jim Thompson was an agent for the OSS, and he was stationed in
      Thailand during WWII. He loved the culture of Thailand so much that he
      decided to move there, where he built a traditional Thai-style house and
      reinvigorated the local silk-making industry, establishing the Jim
      Thompson Thai Silk Company and making Thai silk world-renowned. He
      disappeared quite suddenly at the age of 61 in 1967 in Malaysia,
      coincidentally at the age his horoscope told him to watch out.


      His house was left behind, and it was quite beautiful. He actually took 6
      traditional houses and transported them to the current spot and merged
      them together. Much of the house is designed, built, and decorated in the
      traditional Thai style, with a few alterations for convenience. It's
      basically a museum now, housing Thompson's large collection of artifacts
      from around Southeast Asia, although there is a lot of the house that
      retains some of the living furniture, like the bedroom and living room.


      The whole set up gives you a pretty good insight into Thai houses and
      culture. Some notable factoids: most houses are built on stilts to ward
      against floods; the bedrooms are built with a raised threshold to keep
      babies in and bad spirits out; one of my favorite artifacts was the Mouse
      House, a Chinese kids could place a mouse into and watch him run around
      for hours -- adults would also gamble on which mouse would escape first;
      the house was built inside out to emphasize the carving.


      We returned home relatively early and researched buses to Koh Samed, as
      that is where our first excursion would take us.
