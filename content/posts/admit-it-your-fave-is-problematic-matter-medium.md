        Just like our celebrities and ourselves, the movements we champion are also problematic. Our feminism is racist, classist and transphobic. Our anti-racism is sexist. Our LGBT rights movement is racist and classist. They are all ableist. Acknowledging this isn’t divisive: ignoring it is.

        But oppression isn’t really upheld by virulent bigots, it’s sheltered in the intentions of “good” people like you and me. People too concerned with seeing themselves as good to recognize where they have been bad. It’s time to hold ourselves accountable to the values that shape our movements. Grow up, own up, do better.
