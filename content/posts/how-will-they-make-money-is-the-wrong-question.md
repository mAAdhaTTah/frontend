  - content: "[Josh Elman on Medium, \"'How will they make money?' is the wrong question\"](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/a5890c2c2cc0):\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  In all of these cases, the primary challenge with building a large consumer company is not \x93how will you make money,\x94 but \x93how do you get to be a long-standing durable network and define a new set of behaviors or verbs?\x94 Once you can do that, it\x92s very likely you will be able to monetize at significant scale.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nNot that I'm any sort of expert in this field, per se, but I think he misses out on how the process of monetizing this user base often sacrifices the original goals of the product. You see this with Facebook: users hate the advertising, it doesn't fit with the \"new set of verbs\" they're used to on the network, and I really think they've done a terrible job turning their massive dataset into anything more creative than more targeted ads\\[1. This is obviously not the first time I've [talked about this](https://jamesdigioia.com/linkedin-vision-big-data-whats-facebooks-twitters/ \"LinkedIn Has a Vision for Big Data \x96 What\x92s Facebook\x92s? Twitter\x92s?\").]. I think part of that has to be the focus on building the product before monetizing it that's making this more difficult than it seemed at first blush.\n\nI also thought Ev Williams quote was interesting, that the inability to monetize a large user base is a non-existent problem. Again, it's always going to be possible to monetize a user base -- the better question is whether or not you can do so without a) pissing off your users and/or b) selling our the product's core values and functionality.\n"
