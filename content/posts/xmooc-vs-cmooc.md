  - content: "[Jonathan Haber on Degree of Freedom, \"xMOOC vs. cMOOC\"](http://degreeoffreedom.org/xmooc-vs-cmooc/):\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  The experience I just described made me realize that I like to be taught by a \x93sage-on-the-stage,\x94 or, more particularly, by someone with way more expertise on the subject than I and my fellow students have who is also skilled and experienced at transferring this knowledge to others. \_In no way does this mean that xMOOCs are inherently superior to cMOOCs on the same subject. \_But it does mean that different options may be needed to meet the needs of people with widely varying strengths, weaknesses and preferences that make up their learning styles.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nThis is an interesting observation, given how much sage-on-the-stage gets blasted. As much as I kind of dislike xMOOCs, that model can be preferable to some people, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. The problem with xMOOCs has a lot more to do with marketing/hype, and the host of problems that comes along with that, than merely its format.\n"
