      [My last
      post](https://jamesdigioia.com/hack-pipe-for-functional-programmers-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-placeholder/)
      (the first in *ages*) on Hack pipes for Functional Programmers delved into
      what I see as the primary benefit of Hack pipes over F# pipes. GitHub
      issues notwithstanding, the response to that post was mostly positive, but
      there were a few reasonable objections from the F# camp that would be
      worthwhile to address, which is effectively summarized by the following
      tweet:

      Much of the argument on GitHub revolved around advancing F# pipes
      alongside [Partial Function
      Application](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-partial-application) (PFA),
      and that a more valid comparison between F# & Hack pipes would be between
      F#+PFA & Hack. I'd like to respond some of these concerns here.


      ## PFA has no guarantee of advancing


      For starters, the PFA proposal is a separate proposal with its own
      strengths and issues that would need to be addressed before
      advancing.&#x20;


      ### Hack doesn't kill PFA




      ## PFA + F# doesn't enable expression composition


      Hack pipe's major strength is that it enables the composition of
      expressions.


      ## PFA + F# has similar downsides to Hack


      One of the significant objections to Hack is that you can't name the
      placeholder.&#x20;


      ## PFA + F# doesn't address debugging issues
