      When I first began to see these demands to publish these anti-Muslim
      cartoons, the cynic in me thought perhaps this was really just about
      sanctioning some types of offensive speech against some religions and
      their adherents, while shielding more favored groups. In particular, the
      west has spent years bombing, invading and occupying Muslim countries and
      killing, torturing and lawlessly imprisoning innocent Muslims, and
      anti-Muslim speech has been a vital driver in sustaining support for those
      policies.


      So it’s the opposite of surprising to see large numbers of westerners
      celebrating anti-Muslim cartoons -- not on free speech grounds but due to
      approval of the content. Defending free speech is always easy when you
      like the content of the ideas being targeted, or aren’t part of (or
      actively dislike) the group being maligned.
