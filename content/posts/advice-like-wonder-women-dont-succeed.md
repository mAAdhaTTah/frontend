      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        One problem is that we say to women that you have to claim your voice. Don't make statements that sound like questions. Don't be afraid to speak up. Own the room. Speak with confidence. But to the extent that doesn't come naturally, women, in an effort to do precisely what they've been told, sometimes will over-occupy the space ... We give really mixed messages, and we don't teach women exactly how to do that because it's not very graceful when somebody's trying to claim a room in a meeting.

      Advice like this seems similar to the ["don't be abrasive"
      advice](https://jamesdigioia.com/abrasiveness-good-tactic-advocacy-well-thats-really-point/);
      it mostly serves to make liberation more difficult. Just because it comes
      from successful women doesn't change the fact that it's advice that's only
      matters in a male-dominated context like the corporate world.
