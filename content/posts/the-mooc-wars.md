  - content: "[Martin Weller on The Ed Techie, \"The MOOC Wars\"](http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/05/the-mooc-wars.html):\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  So Clark dismisses the impact of early MOOCers, claiming it was Khan that caused it all: \"It took a hedge fund manager to shake up education because he didn\x92t have any HE baggage.\" Why? Because it appeals to the narrative to have a saviour riding in from outside HE to save education. If you acknowledge that these ideas may have come from within HE then that could look like venture capitalists latching on to a good idea in universities and trying to make money from it. That doesn't sound as sexy and brave.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nThe original Canadian developers of the MOOC (now dubbed the \"cMOOC\") are being written out of the history books. \_Martin has a good idea why.\n"
