      I think my favorite thing about Webassembly is the possibility of being
      able to write both the front- and back-end in a language other than
      JavaScript. Node is great, but sometimes it's not the right choice for a
      particular use case, and being able to choose a language other than
      JavaScript and still get the kind of isomorphism you get running a V8
      instance on a server is amazing.


      I also really want to use it as an opportunity to learn another language.
      If Rust can compile to Webassembly and work in the browser, I can learn
      Rust, and learn it easier because I can apply it in an area that I already
      have a lot of experience. I don't think I'm the only one for whom this is
      true, and I think that's awesome.
