        While the field of survey research has oriented itself almost completely to understanding and articulating the limits of its methods, Rudder copes with Big Data’s potentially even more egregious opportunities for systematic measurement error by ignoring them. “Sometimes,” he argues, “it takes a blind algorithm to really see the data.” Significantly downplayed in this view is how the way OkCupid captures its data points is governed by the political choices and specific cultural understandings of the site’s programmers. Big Data positivism myopically regards the data passively collected by computers to be objective. But computers don’t remember anything on their own.
