      [Hunter in Daily Kos, "Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston bomber draws
      anger,
      controversy"](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/17/1224492/-Rolling-Stone-cover-featuring-Boston-bomber-draws-anger-controversy):


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        I'm not sure that calling someone a "bomber," a "monster" and a member of "radical Islam" counts as glamorizing them. And American magazines have a history of putting terrible, terrible people on their covers; dictators, crooks and yesâ€“murderers. Guess what: They don't all look like monsters. They don't all look like you think they will look. On the other hand, perhaps the wider societal value is in not granting notorious killers a celebrity status, even if unintentional. Is there a secondary effect on other potentially violent individuals?

      This pretty much sums up my thoughts on the Rolling Stone cover: people
      are getting far too bent out of shape over this.
