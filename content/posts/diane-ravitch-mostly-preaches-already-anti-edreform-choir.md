      If you don't know who Diane Ravitch is, you should: she's one of a very
      small group of people who some mainstream stature as an opponent of
      education reform. Like Evgeny Morozov, I appreciate the place she exists
      in our culture, as someone who stands against a culture and its values
      that has gained widespread acceptance. Additionally, the fact that she was
      [once deeply embedded with a movement she now
      refutes](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/09/the-counterrevolutionary/309427/)
      gives her a lot of credibility:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        That year, she published a carefully researched book in which she reflected on the movement she'd helped launch but could no longer support. Surveying the data, she concluded that the reform effort was just another in the parade of high hopes that policy makers and practitioners had promoted through the decades. Their strategies couldn't transform schools into engines of social mobility, because they did little to address the underlying causes of the achievement gap between white and minority students: entrenched segregation and poverty in America's urban core. The book was called [The Death and Life of the Great American School System](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Great-American-School-System/dp/0465025579), but it might as well have been called The Corrections.

      The problem I have with her is similar to the problem I have with Morozov,
      though: she can be shrill, prone to hyperbole, and given to
      characterizations of opponents that is intellectually dishonest:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        Ravitch had taken to social media with the fervor of a teenager, and she responded to critics with fire-hose blasts of tweets and blog posts. Plainly thrilling to the role of polemicist, she accused one 'loathsome' reformer of having 'ruined the life' of a career educator 'for filthy lucre.' Her opponents gave as good as they got. Whitney Tilson, a financier renowned for circulating pro-reform e-mails, denounced Ravitch's 'thuggery.'

      I kind of love that "filthy lucre" line, but I doubt it does much to
      advance the cause for those who are on the fence. She's clearly one who
      spends most of her time preaching to the choir.
