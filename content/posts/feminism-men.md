That\x92s about the way it stands.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nWhile on one hand, I am concerned about taking a philosophy and a movement that is about raising the status of women in our society and making it all about us (men) again. On the flip side, if this convinces people that feminism isn't as simple as people make it out to be, then maybe it's worth something.\n"
