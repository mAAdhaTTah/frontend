      Most people conceive of "freedom" as the freedom to do whatever you'd
      like. But what about the freedom from having things done to you? Like the
      freedom from having your back yard polluted? The freedom from having your
      district redlined and your mortgage denied because of your skin color? The
      freedom from having your personal life distributed on the Internet because
      you have breasts? Do those freedoms count?
