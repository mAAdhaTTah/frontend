      [Zachary M. Seward in Quartz, "How Yahoo plans to make money on Tumblr:
      ads that don't feel like
      ads"](http://qz.com/86437/how-yahoo-plans-to-make-money-on-tumblr-ads-that-dont-feel-like-ads/):

        Creating high-quality native advertising is hard, which is why it wouldn't be surprising if Tumblr also began to fashion itself as an ad agency, charging brands for advice on how to become the next Comedy Central on Tumblr. Indeed, the presentation to advertisers promises "best practices and content strategy support from the Tumblr team."

      I've [previously written about how disappointed I am in Facebook and
      Twitter's ad
      strategy](https://jamesdigioia.com/linkedin-vision-big-data-whats-facebooks-twitters/
      "LinkedIn Has a Vision for Big Data -- What's Facebook's? Twitter's?"),
      how they're not being as innovative and creative with the information they
      have to provide value to potential clients. If this is the strategy Tumblr
      has, creating a platform then managing accounts for businesses to help
      them leverage that platform to reach their audience, I think that's far
      more interesting than straight advertising.
