      Discrimination, as it becomes less obvious, becomes a more difficult
      problem to root out. It becomes less about the obvious repression and more
      about the way past discrimination is still deeply embedded in the social
      fabric. We often generally espouse views of equality and respect, but
      individual actions and views, unbeknownst to ourselves, don't align.


      To start with the niceties, I do think Warren Buffett has his heart in the
      right place. I do think he wants women to be equally represented in the
      workplace. Unfortunately, you can't get equality when you lead with victim
      blaming.
