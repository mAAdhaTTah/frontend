      I just finished reading "More Awesome Than Money" by Jim Dwyer about the
      rise and "fall" of Diaspora as a viable alternative to Facebook. I've
      often thought of Diaspora\* as something that "came and went"; much of the
      story had passed when I heard about it, but while the project started in
      2010, the story of Diaspora\* continues through the Snowden era, so very
      much recent history.


      For me personally, it was the Snowden dump that prompted me to take a look
      at the software, as I've been looking [to decentralize my digital
      life](https://jamesdigioia.com/new-project-wp-gistpen/) since then. Before
      I read the book, this is what I knew about Diaspora\*, and I suspect the
      public narrative is similar:


      1. With a lot of hype as the "Anti-Facebook", they raised a ton of money
      on Kickstarter, including a sizable donation from Zuckerberg himself.

      2. The first version was released with a number of security problems.

      3. The software never really got traction despite the hype.

      4. One of the founding members commit suicide, which sucked the wind out
      of the remaining team...

      5. ...who eventually abandoned the project, turning the software over to
      the community, where it's joined a number of niche open-source social
      networking software.


      The story told by Dwyer isn't that different, though the full story of how
      it happened sheds a lot of insight into why it never Diaspora\* never
      really got traction. They were basically kids, and the whole thing blew up
      to be a lot bigger than anyone expected. They had no plan.


      This hype is basically the same problem Ello has<FootnoteReference id="1"
      /> now: The network [was in
      beta](http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/30/i-spent-48-hours-on-ello-this-is-what-i-saw/),
      but the hype was so significant, it [was doubling in size every 3-4
      days](http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/ello-ello-new-no-ads-social-network-ello-is-blowing-up-right-now/).
      My experience with Ello was as an equally buggy and irritating interface,
      and while Diaspora\*'s first version was intended to be a developer
      release, the version was extremely buggy. According to Dwyer's book, those
      security holes were patched quite quickly, but the perception would haunt
      the project for a long time.


      But even if "the hype" has its drawbacks, and may actually be harmful to
      some of these fledgling networks, what the hype does say is this: People
      *really* don't like Facebook. They didn't like it 5 years ago, and they
      don't like it now. Even though we haven't come up with an alternative that
      we like better, it's inevitable that Facebook's dominance will eventually
      be undone. How long will be people use something they regularly rebel
      against?


      One of the complaints about Diaspora\*, at least from the Free Software
      people, was that it wasn't being developed in the open. While the team was
      dismissive of this complaint, a lot of the perception problems they had on
      the developer release was related to expectations setting a "release"
      engendered. Even if they didn't include anyone's code contributions during
      that time and hemmed to their vision, it would have helped managed user
      expectations as well as get feedback from other developers about some of
      these security concerns well in advance of ever calling it a release. Plus
      if you're going to do open-source, do it right.


      It's also very difficult to start a new social network without it feeling
      like a ghost town. Google+ still suffers from that perception despite a
      serious userbase, and Diaspora\* had to overcome this problem. And Ello is
      already [a ghost
      town](https://twitter.com/benbn/status/522052755637415936), as people fall
      back into their routine. One of Diaspora\*'s developers wasn't even a
      heavy user of the software, which makes it a kinda difficult to figure out
      what your users want.


      But despite the difficulties any of these challengers faced, it seems
      pretty to clear to me, then as now, people **really** want a viable
      alternative to Facebook. Diaspora\*, with a modest aim of $20,000 and a
      summer of development, turned into $200,000 in donations and a several
      year project.


      These are surmountable problems for an open-source social network. We can
      integrate with already existing social networks. We can develop in the
      open. The biggest problem is making these networks work for
      non-developers, and not only on a technical level. Running your own
      server, or even running a website on a basic web host, often suffers a
      perception problem of being overly complicated.
