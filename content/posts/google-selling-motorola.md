      Big news. Interesting that this should happen right after Google bought
      Nest. Sounds like Google didn't really want 2 hardware companies under its
      belt, and Motorola didn't really impress Google, which is why it took so
      long to release the Moto X; none of the phones in Motorola's pipeline were
      good enough to release.


      Also worth noting they bought it for $12 billion and are selling for ~$2-3
      billion.
