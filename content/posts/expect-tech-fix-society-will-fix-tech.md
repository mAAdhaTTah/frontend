      The other part of [last week's
      post](https://jamesdigioia.com/vessyl-whitepeopleproblems-silicon-valleys-insularity/)
      that I didn't touch on was the issues I have, often raised by Evgeny
      Morozov<FootnoteReference id="1" />, with the moral implications of any
      single piece of technology and more importantly, the collective impact of
      our technologies combined. In the particular case of the digital cup, the
      moral trade-off might be worth it.


      A suggestion raised on Facebook was we as human may simply not have the
      cognitive bandwidth to gather all the information we need to eat healthy,
      and that offloading it to a device like this will confer more benefits
      than problems. I'm not sure if I'm convinced that's better than reforming
      our food systems. It's certainly easier, but if we believe our social
      obesity or health issues are solvable via individual technology, then we
      become incapable of dealing with problems on a social level. We can't (or
      won't) reform our food systems if we think better tracking solves the
      problem.


      More generally, these are the questions we don't ask ourselves when we
      adopt technology like this. What are we getting? What are we giving up?
      What cognitive and moral instruments get blunted when we make these
      trade-offs?


      And I don't mean the handwringing of concerned parents over their
      children's use of social media, or the plight of [the
      Disconnectionists](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-disconnectionists/),
      but the deeper loss of our own collective ability to solve problems when
      we turn over certain decision-making to devices. If we can't decide for
      ourselves what food to eat or what to drink, how are we expected to tackle
      global warming, for example?


      More importantly, when we expect technology to solve our bigger problems,
      the problems that get solved by technology are those experienced by a very
      particular group of people<FootnoteReference id="2" />. Technology is
      increasingly being used to the solve the problems of technologists. For
      all the talk of the web as a means of democratization, technology still
      comes embedded within it the power structures of society as a whole. It's
      developed by white men for white men, and we're not going to work on
      wider-impact problems if we turn that process over to this small elite
      group.


      The experiences of the technorati are not the same as the rest of society.
      Who's problems are being solved exactly?
