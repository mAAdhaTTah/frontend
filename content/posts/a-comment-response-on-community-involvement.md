We should be able to determine our own contributions to our communities as well as the choice to receive contributions.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nWhile the rest of the comment was some drivel about liberals and Bill Clinton, this first part is really a significant disagreement I have with much of conservative thought:\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  You don't choose how much you participate because your actions impact your communities whether or not you actively choose participation. You benefit from living in a safer community, whether or not do anything to make it safer. You benefit from having smart people in your community, whether or not you do anything to help them learn. This is why these are collective enterprises; the idea that you're separate from your community and can regulate how much you contribute is really a myth.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n"
