      I don't find myself often disagreeing with Krugman, but there's a strain
      of thought going around that Republicans are suffering from [cognitive
      dissonance in their Obamacare
      opposition](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/obamacare-doublethink/):

        So which is it? Are Republicans sure that disaster looms, or are they terrified because they suspect that things will be OK? My guess is, both: clear thinking is not exactly a hallmark of the modern GOP, and may indeed be a positive disqualification for career success.

      Obama himself just made this argument, and I think Greg Sargent made it as
      well. The thing is, Republicans can want to stop something they think is
      going to be a disaster. I don't know what's so complicated about that.


      Granted, it appears a lot of the information coming out about it says it's
      going to be awesome (or maybe that's just my filter bubble talking), and
      conservatives live in their own filter bubble in which it's going to be a
      disaster. So if you thought it was going to be a disaster, regardless of
      whether it was passed democratically, wouldn't you try to stop it?
