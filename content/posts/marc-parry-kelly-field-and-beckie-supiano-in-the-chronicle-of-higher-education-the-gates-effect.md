        For those who worry about Gates's influence, the concern isn't just about the foundation's ideas. It's the feeling that Gates operates as a de facto lobbying group, one with a direct pipeline to the Department of Education.

        ...

        "When you put all their resources together, they're a rounding error," she says. "There's a huge amount of money at federal and college levels--foundations' budgets are pretty small in the context of that."

        Still, she adds, "I think foundations have an ability to set an agenda, to help clarify an agenda and rally momentum around an agenda."

      I finally got around to reading to Chronicle's report on the Gates
      Foundation and its impact on higher education. If you've been following
      education at all, most of this is not really news; it's pretty much the
      same stuff they've been doing in secondary education this whole time.


      I did want to comment quickly on the sentiment expressed above, though.
      Just because, on a percentage basis, the Gates Foundation is a small part
      of the total amount of money spent in education. And that's true, but
      Gates' focus on policy and research allows it to wield that money in a way
      that gives it more influence than if it was, for example, a school
      district or a vendor.
