      I've previously written about the [need for fiction in the
      classroom](https://jamesdigioia.com/content-vs-reflection-in-the-common-core-standards/
      "Content vs. Reflection in the Common Core Standards"). Well, it turns out
      it's not just me postulating about its positive effects. [There's actually
      brain research on the implications of fiction and social
      interactions](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html

      This is REALLY important. The Common Core State Standards are intended to

      "Gates-Financed Common Core Standards Turn Kindergarten into Global
      Economy Zone"), essentially. The likely effects are not going to be
      pretty, besides the fact that we're developing kids who are going to be
      decreasingly empathetic:

        Another potential indirect effect on students may be their motivation and engagement. we're also going to make kids hate reading.

      Is this really what we want?
