      [Nicholas Lemann in The New Republic, "How Michelle Rhee Misled Education
      Reform"](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113096/how-michelle-rhee-misled-education-reform):


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        Rhee actually does know what life is like in a public school, but she either openly or implicitly removes from the discussion of improving schools any issue that cannot be addressed by twisting the dial of educational labor-management relations in the direction of management. She gives us little or no discussion of pedagogical technique, a hot research topic these days, or of curriculum, another hot topic owing to the advent of the Common Core standards, or of funding levels, or class size, or teacher training, or surrounding schools with social services (which is the secret sauce of Geoffrey Canada's Harlem Children's Zone), or of the burden placed on the system by the expensive growth of special-education programs.

      This is probably the most telling part about the focus of Rhee (and
      edreform in general). They don't get into the intricacies of how teaching
      actually works, instead trying to make schools better through broad
      strokes and sheer force of will.
