The reason should be obvious. As Internet-driven explanations crowd out everything else, our entire vocabulary is being re-defined. Collaboration is re-interpreted through the prism of Wikipedia; communication, through the prism of social networking; democratic participation, through the prism of crowd-sourcing; cosmopolitanism, through the prism of reading the blogs of exotic \x93others\x94; political upheaval, through the prism of the so-called Twitter revolutions.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nEven with how embedded I am in social, tech, and digital culture, I still found the recent declarations of the Arab Spring as [The Twitter Revolution](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/14/the_first_twitter_revolution \"The First Twitter Revolution?\") extremely disingenuous. \_No one denies the role Twitter and Facebook played in organizing and dispersing information, both within and without the Arab world, during the Arab Spring, but to act like the revolts there could not have happened with those technologies is simply incorrect. \_Technologies don't cause revolutions; they facilitate them.\n\nAs I've said, it's great to see a well-read man with an understanding of history provide some perspective on what the internet truly brings to the table. \_Expect to hear more from him -- I'll definitely be reading both his books and writing about them here.\n"
