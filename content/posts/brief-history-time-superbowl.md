  - content: "<ExtendedQuote>\n  His post, now accessible only through the Internet Archive, began as such:\n\n  <ExtendedQuote>\n    Are you wondering, \"what time does the Superbowl start?\"\n\n    It's a common search query, as is \"what time is the super bowl 2011,\" \"superbowl time\" and \"superbowl kickoff time 2011,\" according to Google Trends the evening before the Super Bowl.\n\n    It's easily answered too. Super Bowl 2011 will take place on Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011, at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time.\n  </ExtendedQuote>\n\n  It seems to have read like that through Super Bowl Sunday and the week that followed. By March, the story had been shortened, losing its newsy preamble. Some unknown editor reduced the passage above to:\n\n  <ExtendedQuote>\n    **This story has been edited for greater clarity.**\n\n    Super Bowl 2011 takes place on Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011, at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time and 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time.\n  </ExtendedQuote>\n\n  But the editing came after the great triumph. Kanalley\x92s post, by all reports, did very, very, very well.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n"
