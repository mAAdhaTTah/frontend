      There was a lot of discussion last week about Emily Yoffe's lovely
      victim-blaming piece in Slate (I'm not linking it here because pageviews)
      where she told college-aged women that they should avoid drinking heavily
      to help protect themselves from sexual assault. She also wrote a response
      to her critics, basically saying "I'm just trying to help women protect
      themselves!" A lot of the discussion I saw revolved around the question of
      whether women should be told this and why it's actually terrible advice.


      For starters, Yoffe's "advice" situations itself in an overarching
      cultural narrative that effectively takes male sexual aggression as a
      given and asks women to be responsible for responding to that, rather than
      teaching young boys and men not to rape. Even in her own piece, her
      admonishment to her own son is a single throwaway line, rather than any
      in-depth look at why men treat women so poorly and how our culture informs
      that treatment. Her advice may not seem terrible on its face,\[1. Though
      it is, and I'll get to why.] but it's part of culture that basically
      expects men to mistreat women and does little about it.


      I know this, and I'm not breaking any new ground explaining this, but it
      always left me with a nagging question: Ok, if we're working towards
      fixing the culture, if we're actively trying to teach our men how to act
      in these situations, how to be respectful towards women, if we're on the
      "good" side of this debate, what's the problem with also teaching women
      how to protect themselves? What's wrong with saying "if you don't get
      drunk, you're less likely to get raped"?


      There's something to seeing good advice to understanding why bad advice is
      so bad. So when I read [this piece in Everyday
      Feminism](http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/10/rape-prevention-3-actual-tools/),
      it all made sense:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        I teach skills for stopping harassment, abuse, and assault. I, and other feminist self-defense teachers around the country, focus on increasing women's options, not decreasing them.
      </ExtendedQuote>


      That's basically what it comes down to: telling women "stop getting drunk"
      is disempowering, limits their choices, and takes the freedom and control
      of their lives out of their hands. The writer, Lauren R. Taylor, has some
      actual tips for protecting yourself in empowering ways.


      So that's really it: while the focus really needs to be on teaching men
      how to treat women, we can at least give our women the tools to be in
      control.
