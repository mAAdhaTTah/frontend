      It's unfortunate that the writer takes a shallow angle on this, because
      there's actually an interesting question about whether there is such a
      thing as conservative feminism. And I think is, or could be, in some of
      the ways Western feminism would interact with more conservative cultures
      -- the debates over whether a woman choosing to wear a hijab counts as
      feminism springs to mind.


      But a woman fighting for fewer freedoms for women is never feminism, and
      there's a reason that libertarian women aren't usually welcomed into
      feminist ranks: Asking the government to stay out of it got us to where we
      are now, or at least where we were, and that never lead to increased
      freedoms for women.


      Especially if you're going to define feminism as a question of whether
      women have power, then feminism even more so means advocating for policies
      that would increase that power to help redress the imbalance that lead us
      to this point in time. If libertarianism made an effective argument in
      favor of less government intrusion leading to more power for women, then
      feminism would welcome that conservative aspect of its philosophy. But
      that doesn't happen, hasn't happened, and won't happen, because
      conservatism and libertarianism has never lead to increased power for
      marginalized groups.


      The lack of intervention proposed by libertarianism is always a benefit to
      those in control, to those with power, to the status quo, and it's through
      outside intervention that power is redistributed<FootnoteReference id="1"
      />. Advocating against that redistribution is antithetical to what
      feminism is about. It's not that feminism has banished conservatism from
      its movement; it's that conservatism has nothing to offer feminism.


      <FootnoteDefinition id="1">
        I thought a bit about this line before I published; I don't mean to whitewash away the work done by civil rights activists in agitating for the rights they deserved. I just mean to point out that they were agitating for redress from the government and society at large, and I suspect a libertarian philosophy would never advocate for this type of intervention.
