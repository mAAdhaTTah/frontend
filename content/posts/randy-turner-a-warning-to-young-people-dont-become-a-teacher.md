As any classroom teacher can tell you, when the students know there will be no repercussions for their actions, there will be no change in their behavior. When there is no change in their behavior, other students will have a more difficult time learning.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nWe really very often make the mistake of not listening to those who are most impacted by our statements and policies.
