      If you work in WordPress, you may have run into difficulties displaying
      errors that may occur on the `save_post` hook. Since WordPress redirects
      before loading the post edit page, you don't have access to anything done
      on that hook hook when the post edit page loads. I detail 3 possible
      solutions to in this article for Sitepoint.
