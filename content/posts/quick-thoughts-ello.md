      This was an email response I sent to my mother, after she forwarded me
      [this Vice
      article](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hello-ello-can-we-trust-you):


      I actually got onto this network the other day. They're going through some
      growing pains still, so it's kind of unstable and definitely some of the
      UI decisions are kinda poor. It's obviously a network designed by
      designers for designers. Which is basically a group of straight white
      guys. One of the interesting criticisms of it from a sociological
      perspective is how designing something without that kind of diversity in
      the process produces technology that it tends to limit the users full
      range of expression, via things like binary gender selection during
      signup, and fails to consider how people want to control who sees what
      they say, like via a block button (which as far as I'm aware is still
      missing).


      I've just been reading about this particular promise they've made; it
      seems unlikely they're be able to keep it long-term. They did take VC
      funding, so it's pretty likely they'll be pushed to make money somehow
      soon enough. And how else are they going to do it than selling data?


      I mean, I wish them luck -- would be great to have a popular social
      network that doesn't sell your data like that, but I remain skeptical that
      they're really going to be able to follow through on their promises.
