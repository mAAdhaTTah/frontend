      This is not the first article I've read that suggested the unrest in
      Baltimore is more of a class issue than a race one, given the diversity of
      the police force and government officials there. I can't say I'm entirely
      convinced, even just given the anecdote provided in this story, but it's
      certainly not the same situation as Ferguson, which had a mostly white
      police force extracting revenue from a largely black community.
