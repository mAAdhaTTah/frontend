        Put another way, are we the sum of our brains + our phones, since those phones are with us all the time? If a person is so forgetful and self-involved that she neglects to say even a quick "happy birthday" to her mother -- but then her phone reminds her -- is she still forgetful and self-involved? Or has the phone fundamentally changed her character?
