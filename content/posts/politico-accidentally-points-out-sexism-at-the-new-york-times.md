      Late last night, Politico published [an expose on Jill Abramson's
      "turbulent leadership" at the New York
      Times](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/new-york-times-turbulence-90544.html).
      Unfortunately, it appears the piece can be summed up like this: New York
      Times reporters don't like working for a woman.


      The piece twists itself into knots, trying to figure out how to best
      criticize her work; Abramson, the woman who led the Times to win four
      Pulitzer's this year, established a paywall that has helped shore up the
      Times' digital revenue, embraced the web's technology with innovative
      pieces like "[Snow
      Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek),"
      and helped maintain this struggling newspaper as the "paper of record," is
      alternately "impossible" to work with but isn't around enough or
      "approachable;" alternately "very unpopular right now" and leaving the
      Times "leaderless" but still "very respected there."
