      I love Evgeny Morozov, and the feisty back-and-forth he gets into at the
      end is really the core of the debate he's having with the tech industry:
      the problem isn't "technology"; the problem is the way we think about and
      relate to technology and the socio-political structures around them.


      That said, I do think the questioner's POV is valid: at least in this
      talk, he doesn't articulate any particular action we're supposed to take
      as a result of his ideas. It's all pretty much grounded in changing the
      way we think about it.


      Granted, I'm a fairly big believer in the idea that what we do and how our
      society is structured is, in a lot of ways, a result of the way we think
      about things, and that our actions (and by extension, our society) will
      change if we think differently about the way we approach things. However,
      I do think that if the problem, as he says, is our venture capitalists,
      then even changing the way we think about the problem isn't by default a
      solution to the problem. At least for us as outsiders.


      So that changes who his audience is, really; he's not talking to regular
      people so much as he's talking to the industry. Those within, those with
      the power and control, have to buy into his vision of technology as
      inherently political, that the design decisions (and even the decision to
      make a particular piece of technology at all) is inherently political.
      That algorithms are inherenetly political.


      Unfortunately, so far, while I'm sure he's influential, I'm not really
      convinced his ideas are sticking in the minds of those who's minds need
      sticking.
