      Today, I'm starting a new experiment; I've been working on a plugin called
      [WordPress-GitHub
      Sync](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-github-sync), which exports
      my WordPress posts to markdown on GitHub, as well as imports those posts
      if I make changes there. You can see the plugin at the link below.


      It's *probably* ready for production, but I'm running it as a beta on my
      site over the next week to make sure. Definitely interested in getting
      some feedback, and it'll probably be going up on WordPress.org next
      weekend.


      This also means you can fork and open pull requests against my writing.
      See a typo? Find a sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense? Got an idea
      you'd like to expand on? I'd love to get your input!
