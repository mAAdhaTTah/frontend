      I generally really like Matt Di Carlo and the Shanker Blog. They do a good
      job of explaining a lot of the problematic math behind test-based
      accountability. However, even from the "moderates" in this debate, the
      thing missing are the actual *kids*. Nowhere in the discussion is whether
      it's worthwhile for kindergarteners to spend their time TAKING A TEST (and
      all the test prep that goes along with it).
