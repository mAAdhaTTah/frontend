      [Kickstarter Blog, "We Were
      Wrong"](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/we-were-wrong):


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        On Wednesday morning Kickstarter was sent a blog post quoting disturbing material found on Reddit. The offensive material was part of a draft for a "seduction guide" that someone was using Kickstarter to publish. The posts offended a lot of people – us included – and many asked us to cancel the creator's project. We didn't.

        We were wrong.

      This is how you handle a PR disaster. Apologize and fix it.
