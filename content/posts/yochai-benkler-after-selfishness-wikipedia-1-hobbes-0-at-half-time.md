        When people think they're treated fairly, they're more motivated to act; the core idea of separating fairness and justice from productivity and incentives misses the reality of what people care about.

      This video is pretty much brilliant. I personally have a strong aversion
      to making moral arguments from an economic perspective, but this lecture
      lends credence to my increasing suspicion that the arguments can go hand
      in hand -- that a just society is in fact a more productive one.
