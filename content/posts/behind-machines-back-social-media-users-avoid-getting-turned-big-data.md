      This is interesting insofar as some of the more obtuse practices on social
      media does make it difficult for the algorithm to do its job, but framing
      that as the purpose, rather than a side effect, is simply wrong. Most
      people aren't terribly conscious of their actions as it relates to
      algorithms, and these things, especially subtweets, are more akin to
      social markers (as someone who's in-the-know) than deliberate attempts to
      avoid being tracked.
