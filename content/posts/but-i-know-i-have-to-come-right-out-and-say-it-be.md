      But I know I have to come right out and say it, because very few people in
      education technology will: there’s a problem with computer technology.
      Culturally. Ideologically. There’s a problem with the Internet. Largely
      designed by men from the developed world, it is built for men of the
      developed world. Men of science. Men of industry. Military men. Venture
      capitalists. Despite all the hype and hope about revolution and access and
      opportunity that these new technologies will provide us, they do not
      negate hierarchy, history, privilege, power. They reflect those. They
      channel it. They concentrate it, in new ways and in old.
