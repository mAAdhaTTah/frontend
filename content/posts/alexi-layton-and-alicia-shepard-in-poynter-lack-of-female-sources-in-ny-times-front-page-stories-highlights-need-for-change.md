      [Alexi Layton and Alicia Shepard in Poynter, "Lack of female sources in NY
      Times front-page stories highlights need for
      change"](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/217828/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change/):

        The New York Times is one of the world's leading news organizations. But there's room for improvement â€“ especially when it comes to diversity.

        In an analysis of 352 front-page stories from the Times in January and February 2013, we found that Times reporters quoted 3.4 times as many male sources as female sources.

        Sources were identified as either male, female or unknown. Unknown were institutions, those only quoted as "spokespersons," anonymous sources, etc. In total, only 19 percent (or 465 of 2,411) sources were female. The front-page stories were categorized as World, U.S., Politics, Art, Business, DealBook, Education, Health, N.Y./Region, Science, Sports, Style and Technology.

      I think it's interesting to note that even stories with female bylines
      quote more male sources, though the disparity is far less. Hiring more
      female reporters would certainly help, but doesn't completely solve the
      problem.
