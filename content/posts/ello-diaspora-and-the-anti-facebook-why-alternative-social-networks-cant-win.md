      If it's true that "the buzz about would-be Facebook killers is reaching a
      new crescendo," then there might be an opportunity for an alternative like
      Ello or another unknown social network to at least get large enough to
      threaten Facebook's dominance. Unfortunately, none of the networks that
      have come up before Ello had features that were actually appealing to
      users, and a "Facebook without ads" isn't a big enough draw long-term to
      continue to bring people in.
