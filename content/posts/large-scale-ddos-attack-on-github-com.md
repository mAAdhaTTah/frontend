      [Commenters on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9284226)
      are saying this is being done by China in order to get them to remove some
      software they don't like. Specifically, this organization, [Great
      Fire](https://github.com/greatfire), who develops software to get around
      the Great Firewall of China, and [this
      repo](https://github.com/cn-nytimes/mirrors) which provides a list of
      mirrors for the New York Times, which, as you probably know, is banned in
      China. This has been going on since Thursday, and I'm surprised I haven't
      seen more coverage for it elsewhere.
