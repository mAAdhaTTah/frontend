        At a time when the Republicans are beclowning themselves, liberal Democrats need only to remain cohesive and even-keeled while the right hangs itself politically. But when it appears as if even the most liberal of the Democratic candidates are out of touch with African-American activists, and when it appears as if the progressive base is caught in the throes of in-fighting, it exposes political weaknesses to be exploited.
