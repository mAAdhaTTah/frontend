        In other words, clever individuals, the heroes of the marketplace, ask the questions which are answered by collective behavior. They put the jellybeans in the jar.

      I had strong disagreements with this piece until this part -- he spends
      much of it downplaying the power of crowds and algorithms, but I think at
      this moment, he moves from criticism to nuance, and gives the whole piece
      a lot more power. Long, but very fascinating.
