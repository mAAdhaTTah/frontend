      [Aaron Bady in Academic Matters, "The MOOC bubble and the attack on public
      education"](http://www.academicmatters.ca/2013/05/the-mooc-bubble-and-the-attack-on-public-education/):


      <ExtendedQuote>
        And while MOOC-boosters like to deride the "sage on the stage" model of education-delivery--as if crowded lecture halls are literally the only kind of classroom there is--most of the actually-existing MOOCs being marketed today are not much more than a massive and online version of that very same "sage on the stage" model.
      </ExtendedQuote>


      This is the ultimate irony in the new MOOC movement: they decry the
      elitism and lectures of the old model while essentially recreating those
      same structures in the new model. What's the quote? "You become what you
      hate."? Something like that...
