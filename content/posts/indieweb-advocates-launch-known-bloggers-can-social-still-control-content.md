      This is really cool; WordPress, which I'm a huge fan of obviously, doesn't
      make it particularly easy to interoperate between social networks. I'd
      love for there to be a really easy way for individuals to host their own
      data, via a blog or whathaveyou, while providing simple interoperability
      between it and the major social networks. I've got a decent set up for my
      blog, but it really only works well with Twitter and Facebook; Known works
      the same for now, so I'm certainly not going to switch anytime soon, but
      if this effort makes it easy to work with Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tumblr,
      I could seriously consider switching.
