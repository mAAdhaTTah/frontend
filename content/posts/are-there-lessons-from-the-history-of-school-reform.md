These reformers have their eyes fixed on the future not the horrid present where schools, in their charitable view, are dinosaurs. These reformers are allergic to the history of school reform; they are ahistorical activists that carry the whiff of arrogance associated with the uninformed.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nInteresting to note that edreformers suffer from the same lack of historical perspective as the Silicon Valley hype machine.\n"
