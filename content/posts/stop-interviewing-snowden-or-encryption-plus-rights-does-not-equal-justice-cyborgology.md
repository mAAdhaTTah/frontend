        We don’t need better encryption, we need better governance. Even new and better methods of data encryption and transmission were invented, do we think that governments and corporations won’t stop trying to crack it? Are we advocating a doomed arms race? Even if you think private citizens will win, what kind of power dynamics does that promote? Who holds the power when the only thing standing between you and unchecked state authority is an engineer who doesn’t think racism exists?
