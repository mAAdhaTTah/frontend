I have to admit that I was predisposed to dislike Klein\x92s book when it came out, probably out of professional turf-defending and whatever \x97 but her thesis really helps explain a lot about what\x92s going on in Europe in particular.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nHonestly, it's about time he connected the push towards austerity with Klein's Shock Doctrine. \_It's seemed fairly obvious to me the two were connected, and he's hinted at similar issues before in arguing that the real reason for the push towards austerity is to dismantle the welfare state, not because it actually results in higher growth.\n"
