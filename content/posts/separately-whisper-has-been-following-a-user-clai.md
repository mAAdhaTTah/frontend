      Separately, Whisper has been following a user claiming to be a
      sex-obsessed lobbyist in Washington DC. The company’s tracking tools allow
      staff to monitor which areas of the capital the lobbyist visits. “He’s a
      guy that we’ll track for the rest of his life and he’ll have no idea we’ll
      be watching him,” the same Whisper executive said.
