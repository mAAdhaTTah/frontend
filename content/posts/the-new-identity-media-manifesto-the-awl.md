        Strange things happen when society’s most privileged people start to feel like victims!

      And indeed they do. It's an interesting look at undiscussed white identity
      politics, but I was most struck by this line from Reaxxion's manifesto,
      quoted in the article:


      <ExtendedQuote>
        I aim to protect the interests of heterosexual Western males, a category I’m in. The far-left is trying to censor and criminalize masculine behaviors that are normal. They want to relabel consensual sex as “rape” and relabel innocent flirting as “harassment,” and as I learned with #gamergate, they’ve successfully infected the gaming industry and gaming journalist sites by damaging the very nature of gaming development to fit their extreme political agenda. So while I don’t play video games, the idea of starting a pro-#gamergate site is compatible with my overall mission.

      This is the heart of the culture war: The normalization of aggression and
      dominance vs the understanding of those behaviors as problematic and
      primarily socialized, and therefore open to change. The privileged compare
      what they had to what they have and cries oppression, while the oppressed
      class looks at what they have and what they don't.
