Participants had milliseconds to assess whether a person (or \x93target\x94) on the screen was carrying a gun. If the person had a gun, the participant had to quickly push a button to \x93shoot\x94 the person. If the person had something else, like a wallet or a cell phone, participants had to press a different button. Time and again, research subjects wrongly shot the unarmed Black \x93targets.\x94 And here is the kicker: Correll\x92s findings held even when the research subjects were Black. In other words, even Black people are more likely to shoot unarmed Black targets than armed white targets.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nEven if we're not consciously considering race in a situation, there's often something lurking beneath the surface. Accusing someone of \"injecting race\" into something is dumb, because race is already in *everything*.\n"
