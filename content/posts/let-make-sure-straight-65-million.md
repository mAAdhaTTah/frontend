      Let me make sure I have this straight: 65 million years ago a meteorite
      slammed into a box containing a cat and a small amount of radioactive
      material. The cat and the radioactive material exploded and caused the Big
      Bang, which turned the cat into multicats and "dark matter" (and, with
      cats, I think we all know what that is!). It was then this endless army of
      visible, semi-visible, invisible, and possibly dead cats, drunk on red
      wine, attacked and killed all the dinosaurs, who are secretly trying to
      clone themselves using the small wrenches, screwdrivers, drills and other
      tools used in quantum mechanics. Is that close enough for Einstein, or
      does there have to be some math involved?
