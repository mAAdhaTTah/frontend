They have two professional laptops: one that is serviceable and upgradeable, and one that is not. They\x92re not exactly equivalent products \x97 one is less expensive and supports expandable storage, and the other has a cutting-edge display, fixed storage capacity, and a premium price tag \x97 but they don\x92t have the same name just to cause confusion. Rather, Apple is asking users to define the future of the MacBook Pro.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nGiven the success of the Macbook Air, I have no doubt the locked-down version will win out in this market test; most people simply do not care about the tinkerability of their devices (see: iPad, iPhone). Batteries cannot be replaced, hard drives cannot be upgraded, RAM cannot be expanded, and the user will be wholly\_dependent\_upon Apple to do anything to their devices.\n\nAll of this isn't just an academic exercise, either. \_The original Macbook Pro I had died, and I opened the computer up, pulled out the hard drive, and transferred it into my dad's Macbook Pro (which he hardly used; 17\" was too heavy). \_While in the computer, I upgraded the hard drive to a 750GB 7200 RPM drive, turned the LCD screen from the old computer into a monitor, and switched the optical drive out of my old MBP into the new one.\n\nAfter the second one died, I pulled that drive out, put it into a hard drive case for desktops, and put it into my 6 year old Mac Pro. \_That drive is now in my new computer. \_All of this is impossible on the new Macbook Pro. \_If my computer died now, I could recover my data from a backup, but all those parts are useless.\n\nUpdate: It appears now that [the new iMac will also feature this design](http://www.ibtimes.com/apple-reveals-redesigned-2012-imac-price-points-start-1299-21-inch-1799-27-inch-mac-852444):\n\n<ExtendedQuote citation=\"\">\n  By laminating the display directly to the glass, Apple was able to remove all air gaps from the computer, making the entire display system 45 percent thinner. By removing the optical drive and reeingereering the internal components, Apple was able to make the new iMac \x93amazingly thin.\x94 This is Apple's first untinkerable desktop. \_I doubt the Mac Pro will ever feature this sort of design, because of the particular market it appeals to and the philosophy behind its design (it's extremely easy to add and remove hard drive and RAM, and there are processor upgrade kits you can buy as well). \_The Mac Mini could go either way.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nBesides these problems with the lack of an open platform, the new MBP isn't recyclable ([and ignore what EPEAT says; they're full of it](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/apple-and-epeat-greenwashing/)). We don't think about new technology and their environmental impact, and people often believe, perhaps erroneously, that technology will solve all our environmental problems without discussing the problems of the mining of [rare](http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/green-screen/rare_earth_the_new_nonrenewables)[earth](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680333/will-mining-for-rare-earth-metals-destroy-greenland)[metals](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/business/global/china-vows-tighter-controls-over-rare-earth-mining.html), [ewaste](http://www.electronicstakeback.com/green-design-vs-greenwashing-2/hard-to-recycle/), and [electricity consumption](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=all).\n\nSo I have an apparent tension between my appreciation of the OS X and my distaste for the build of the devices themselves. \_And that's where the Hackintosh comes in.\n\nI had overheard the tech guy at my last job discussing working on building his own Hackintosh, which sounded just like a cool idea at the time, but most likely\_unnecessary\_for me. \_When I decided to do the build, I first found [a guide](http://lifehacker.com/5841604/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-building-a-hackintosh), then the amazing community at [Tonymacx86](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php), both of which were helpful for getting started, but the process did still require a ton of searching, tweaking, and good old-fashioned trial-and-error.\n"
