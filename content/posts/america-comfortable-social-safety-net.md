      TPM reports that insurance companies have spent the past fews months
      [pretending the health insurance exchanges don't
      exist](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/insurance-companies-misleading-letters-obamacare)
      and trying to funnel their current customers into more expensive plans.
      The obnoxious/relevant portion is this:

        Fast forward a month, and Donna was able to log onto Washington's marketplace and shop for insurance. And what did she find? Options. A LifeWise plan with the same deductible they offered her outside the exchange was a little cheaper. Plans with a lower deductible had the same or lower premiums as the LifeWise plan. What she ended up buying was a plan through Community Health Plan of Washington with a $250 deductible.

        And crucially, she also discovered she would qualify for a federal tax subsidy that would knock her monthly premium to $80. Her daughter could enroll in Medicaid, at no cost to the family.

        So here's the bottom line: If Donna had taken the default option that LifeWise offered outside of the marketplace, she would have paid nearly $1,000 more per month for a worse plan than she was able to obtain on the marketplace.

      Someone commented that this wouldn't happen if we had single-payer (or a
      public option, I think, though I supposed I'm less convinced of that). The
      public option was floated as a possibility when Obamacare was in its
      design, though it never made it into the final version (obviously). Yves
      Smith argues that it wasn't "political constraints" that prevented this
      from coming to fruition though:


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        'Wasn't going to happen?' Krugman's remarkably passive and compliant attitude reminds me of the Obama Fans who kept bleating 'He's only been in office one two three four five six X months! Give him a chance!' (That, or, 'The President is not a dictator!') Think back. Does you remember the state of play in January, 2009? The Democrats had just won the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They had just beaten the McCain/Palin ticket like a gong. Thanks to a brilliant, tactically ruthless campaign – and the [lingering good will on the Democratic balance sheet for economic issues](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/time-and-chance/), perhaps remnants from FDR's time – Obama's Democrats had a mandate for "hope and change." Moreover, the Republicans under Bush had been completely discredited, both in the eyes of a majority of the public and, even more importantly, in the political class of opinion shapers. Obama's personal charisma was at its height. So too, like all Presidents in their 100 Days, was his power. If Obama had wanted to make single payer the hallmark of his 100 Days, instead of HeritageCare -> RomneyCare -> ObamaCare, he could have done so. And he could have gotten it passed, via reconciliation or [ending the filibuster](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/07/the-obama-enablers-big-lie-we-never-had-the-votes.html) in the Senate if need be. Moreover, Krugman's absurd claim to the contrary, single payer is both well known, in the form of Medicare, and [polls well](http://www.medicareforall.org/pages/Chart_of_Americans_Support). (That's why the TPers don't want government interfering with their Medicare! They reconcile the cognitive dissonance of a government program actually working to their satisfaction by denying it's a government program at all.) The 100 Days were there for the taking. Replace "\[P]olitical constraints made a single-payer system unachievable" with "Obama and the Democrats decided against a single payer system" and you'll have something closer to the truth, if that matters these days.

      \[Yes, that was written as all one paragraph :( ]


      All of these things may have been true, though I think the current
      objection and ferocious attacks on Obamacare as it currently stands would
      have been made much worse if there was a public option/single payer. While
      currently the opposition is mostly being fought from the far-right, the
      fact is, as Yves says, the idea started as a conservative, Heritage
      Foundation idea. If its implementation included more liberal ideas, you
      may start pulling in more moderate conservative who may have also balked
      at the idea and made this current implementation even more difficult than
      it already is.


      Which obviously leads to the question of why Europe, with much of its
      shared history - especially in the 20th century - is able to have such a
      strong social safety net while America still lags. Ta-Nehisi Coates
      basically argues [the destruction caused by World War
      II](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/11/war-and-welfare-went-hand-in-hand/281107/)\[1.
      Among other things; I don't mean to downplay the significance of his other
      reasons.] lead the continent to be far more open to the idea of the
      government taking care of us


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        When I was younger it was popular for my leftie friends to ask "Why can't we be like Western Europe?" We probably can. A good first step, it seems, would be fighting a genocidal war which results in massive relocations, more ethnic homogeneity, the near-extermination of one of our minorities (one guess at who that would be) and the reduction of our major cities to rubble.

      Especially during the 20th century, America was one of the richest, most
      powerful countries in the world, and while Europe was building its welfare
      state, America got its much later, and much weaker. Which basically leads
      to reasking the title question: is America too comfortable to strongly
      advocate for a social safety net?
