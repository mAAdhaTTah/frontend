This isn't to say there aren't people who have done a lot of great writing/thinking around privacy -- the problem is that thinking has developed into any social norms about what kind of privacy we demand from our government. This is why the first policy reaction to the revelation, the Amash Amendment, was to shut it completely, because we didn't realize how we had really let it get, so we pulled back sharply.\n\nAny specifics for policy-making to slow down (or reverse) the growth of the surveillance state will likely take a while as we hammer exactly how much privacy we want versus how much spying will allow. Hopefully now, at least, the conversation will be out in the open.\n"
