      Some more interesting perspective on the impact venture capital is going
      to make on the future of Ello.


      Edited to add: This is what I get for not reading the whole thing. The
      article itself actually suggests quitting Ello for taking venture capital,
      the point being that it's already been sold, and otherwise you are the
      ones creating its value for the eventual exit. Much more provocative than
      my initial post.
