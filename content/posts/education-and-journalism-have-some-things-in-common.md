      Tim Worstall in Forbes, ["What MOOCs Will Really Kill Is The Research
      University"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/07/27/what-moocs-will-really-kill-is-the-research-university/):


      <ExtendedQuote citation="">
        The internet has shown itself to be extremely good at unbundling things, exposing cross subsidies. And it is undoubtedly true that undergraduate education subsidises research: so, if undergraduate education becomes cheap and cheerful videos, then who or what is going to pay for the research? And I suspect that the loudest screaming will come from those who are worried that, once we've exposed the cross subsidies and now must make the decision about which research to pay for directly, won't get their research paid for.

      I thought this bit was interesting because it has a lot in common with
      what's going on in journalism: basically, the stuff that everyone reads
      (sports, celebrity gossip), for the most part, cross-subsidizes the harder
      reporting. The problem that both journalism and MOOCs have is that the
      stuff that gets the attention and thus the money isn't always the most
      important stuff.


      Worstall points out some of the dissertations in the arts as stuff that
      probably will (and should) go, but what he doesn't mention is other
      research that's also really important but doesn't have the kind of
      obvious, money-making use will also go, and that will hurt everyone.
