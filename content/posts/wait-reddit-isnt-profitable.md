Here\x92s a numberless graph showing the (rough) relative difference between expenses vs revenues:\n\n  [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fhes_i0Dd1Q/UgE1mtOQZZI/AAAAAAAAAAM/B-Uh0j5UHyU/s400/expenses_vs_revenues.png)](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/08/reddit-myth-busters_6.html)\n\n  Expenses are projected through the end of 2013, revenues are as of 2013 Q2 -- numbers have been removed to thwart would-be Wall Street analysts. The graph is derived from our internal accounting.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nI'm really surprised by this. I would have assumed a website getting that much traffic would be able to monetize it.\n"
