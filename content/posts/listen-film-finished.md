      Seriously guys, this is kind of important. This documentary takes a look
      at standardized testing from the perspective of those most affected by it:
      the students. It was produced by a freshman in college who took a semester
      off after securing backing on Kickstarter.


      I backed him for a small, and I'm really excited the film is finished. I
      implore you all to watch the short trailer contained in this post, and I
      will most definitely be either hosting a screening myself or helping
      someone organize a screening.


      Please share this and help me get the word out!
