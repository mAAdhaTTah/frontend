  Is "abrasiveness" a good tactic for advocacy? Well, that's not really the
  point...

Basically, a recent study finds that the typical abrasive militancy\\[1. And I'm using \"militant\" throughout jokingly. Obviously, not all abrasive advocates are militant in the traditional sense.] of environmental and feminist advocates tends to turn most people off from their point of view. Makes sense -- people tend to dig their heels in when they're being attacked (myself included) rather than change their mind. However, I think writer Alexandra Brodsky makes a good point:\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  Look, I get it. Sometimes you have to play Friendly Feminist to achieve your goal. Sometimes you don\x92t have the luxury of pissing people off and waiting for them to come around to your position; we make compromises to survive. But you know what? Other times the most powerful way to get what you want is to make some trouble. Maybe the politician whose vote you need won\x92t listen unless you\x92re loud, or your community won\x92t actually stop to think about your position until you make people uncomfortable. Maybe you need to make [literal noise](http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/26/led-davis-democrats-defeat-abortion-legislation/) (by the old definition of \x93literal\x94) until midnight to stall an abortion bill.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\n<ExtendedQuote>\n  And that abrasive shouting can, in itself, be a feminist victory. Whatever occasional strategic value one might find in Jacobs\x92 point, it\x92s clear that society\x92s insistence that activists \x97 particularly women activists \x96 hush up isn\x92t advice proffered for our own good. While it\x92s often dressed up as such generosity (as many young and/or marginalized feminists who have bucked against the established non-profit/government elite can attest), the tone-policing insistence on unobtrusive [\x93civil\x94 discourse](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0921-occidental-sexual-assaults-20130921,0,6550212.story) functions to preserve current distributions of power. As many other feminists and I have [written about](http://feministing.com/2013/05/03/feminist-radicalism-isnt-a-brand-problem/) [before](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/22/rape-culture-university-must-end), \x93good girls\x94 are quiet and accommodating \x97 which is both comfortable and safe for those whose privilege rests upon our subordination. It is unsurprising, then, that the vocalized anger of queer women, trans women, women of color is particularly vilified. So much power depends upon the enforced silence of these voices.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nBasically, the \"abrasiveness\" of militant advocates isn't simply a means to an end; it's sole purpose isn't to convince you of a point of view so much as its a *ends in its own right.* I do ask if it's possible to be both civil and loud, but the answer is really no: society automatically sees anyone trying to disrupt the social order as uncivil by definition, so you can't really make an argument for disruption without automatically being labeled as a troublemaker. As an advocate, it's useful research to keep aware of and choose to be militant or not based on your goals.\n\nThe only other thing I'd add is this argument doesn't really apply to environmentalism. It seems like that movement could benefit from more civility, insofar as the arguments aren't usually being made on behalf of oppressed (human) groups.\\[2. There's something to be said about the intersection of exploited resources and exploited communities.] Environmentalism in particular has suffered quite a bit in its initial growth, as it focused mostly on saving the environment as separate from ourselves. (Save the pandas! Save the polar bears! Save the rainforest!)\n\nNow, it's turned quite a bit more towards how the environmental damage will hurt us, and especially how it will hurt those without resources the most, but with environmentalism, at least in the US, it's less often the oppressed groups speaking for protecting the environment for their benefit.\\[3. I'm not entirely convinced of my own logic here, so I'm willing to be convinced that my logic on environmentalism is wrong. Feel free to tell me how.]\n"
