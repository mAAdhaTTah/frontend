      Coates does an excellent job decrying what passes for leftist "radicalism"
      when it comes to race.

        One does not find anything as damaging as the carceral state in the Sanders platform, but the dissonance between name and action is the same. Sanders’s basic approach is to ameliorate the effects of racism through broad, mostly class-based policies—doubling the minimum wage, offering single-payer health-care, delivering free higher education. This is the same “A rising tide lifts all boats” thinking that has dominated Democratic anti-racist policy for a generation. Sanders proposes to intensify this approach. But Sanders’s actual approach is really no different than President Obama’s. I have repeatedly stated my problem with the “rising tide” philosophy when embraced by Obama and liberals in general. (See [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/01/the-american-case-against-a-black-middle-class/267385/), [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/a-rising-tide-lifts-all-yachts/280224/), [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/a-rising-tide-lifts-mostly-yachts/279769/), and [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/a-rising-tide-lifts-all-yachts/276880/).) Again, briefly, treating a racist injury solely with class-based remedies is like treating a gun-shot wound solely with bandages. The bandages help, but they will not suffice.
