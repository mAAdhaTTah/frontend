      Every year, Heidi and I take a camping trip up to the Adirondacks. This
      year is the fourth year running, although we missed last year, as I was
      between jobs and couldn't afford it. This year, we returned to our usual
      site, [Forked Lake](http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/24467.html), where we
      will, as usual, stay at a boat-accessible-only campsite. That means we
      have to rent a canoe and use that to travel across the lake to get to our
      campsite - it's not accessible by car. It's a wonderful trip, and even if
      you don't go to the Adirondacks, I highly recommend taking a outside of
      the city. It does wonders for the soul.


      ## Arrival


      We left NYC and came down to New Jersey to my parents place the night
      before. Since we were going to be borrowing my parents car as well as much
      of their camping equipment, it's easier to spend the night there and leave
      in the morning than coming down the day of, packing, and leaving.\[1.
      Obviously.] We actually managed to get out and on the road around the time
      we were expecting, around noon-ish, and were hoping the 5 hour drive, plus
      stops for food and natural duties would get us to the campsite around
      5:30-6ish. That would give us plenty of time to get across the lake and
      set up the campsite set up and the fire started for dinner with enough for
      dinner with the sun still out.


      Best laid plans and all that... we ended up hitting traffic pretty early
      on, and I-87 had a lot of construction and congestion, making the trip
      pretty slow going for big portions of the trip. What is normally a 5 hour
      journey ended up taking closer to 7.5 hours.


      On the way up, it rained on and off as well, which was both a good thing,
      as raining now is better than raining while were setting up, and a bad
      thing, as a few times the intensity of the rain made travel slow going. As
      we crossed into the Adirondacks, it's now the green area on the GPS,
      rather than any sign, that tells us we're getting close.


      We arrived at the ranger station just before 8PM. During check in, we were
      told there were no bear sightings this year, so that was nice to know. We
      rented our canoe and loaded it up as quickly as possible. Fortunately,
      Heidi packed most of our stuff into various garbage bags, making packing
      the canoe super simple. We shoved off the shore and we were about halfway
      across the lake as the sun was setting.


      The timing ended up being pretty perfect regardless of the delays. We
      found our campsite with just enough light to see the site number marked on
      the tree, and we unloaded and pulled the boat onto the shore just as it
      got dark. The site itself is pretty well laid out, and I set up the tent
      as Heidi started the fire for dinner. We had bought some cod and
      seasonings before we took off and ate a very nice meal of seasoned cod and
      asparagus along with the wine my mom had provided for us.


      We didn't stay up too late, as the bugs arrived and started nipping at us
      pretty quickly, so we cleaned up, hopped into the tent, and fell asleep
      for the evening.


      ## Day 1


      The first full day we stayed at the campsite was relatively lazy, compared
      to the second. The previous day, we had the forethought to pick up a fire
      starter, but we only got one. When we awoke around 10AM, we unsuccessfully
      attempted to start a fire with the damp kindling scattered around our
      campsite. After finally coming to the realization that this wasn't
      happening,\[2. And wasting a whole book of matches in the process.] and
      with no coffee to make anything even a little more pleasant, we shoved the
      canoe in the water to head into town.


      With the wind at our backs in the morning, the trip in was relatively
      quick. The clouds from last night had mostly dissipated, though it was a
      little chilly with the wind. Halfway across the lake, Heidi stopped to
      take some pictures with my phone.\[3. Which, quite frankly, almost gave me
      a heart attack. I told her, half-joking, if that phone goes in the lake,
      she's going in after it. Fortunately, nothing happened.] Once we hit the
      beach, we flipped the boat and hopped in the car to drive to Stewart's,
      which has become a regular ritual for our morning coffee.


      We got our coffee, some breakfast food, and some supplies - firestarters,
      more ice, and most importantly, beer.\[4. A 12-pack of Heineken, to be
      specific. They had Blue Moon, which is our usual staple, but for some
      reason, Heidi wasn't in the mood for that. I like Heineken, as far as
      cheap-ish beers go. That and Bud Heavies make for pretty good
      party-staples.] We drank our coffee and ate our donuts at the tables out
      front, where we were unfortunately accosted by a pair of bees who thought
      the sweet glazed donut would make a great snack.\[5. Neither of us were
      stung.] We then drove back to the beach to shove off back to the campsite.


      This time around, there was a significant headwind returning to the
      campsite. We hemmed close to shoreline to protect ourselves from as much
      of it as possible, but there is a point where it's necessary to cut
      directly across the lake, and doing so was a bit of struggle.\[6. The
      hardest part, I think, is keeping the boat pointed in the direction you're
      trying to go. You get blown off course pretty constantly, although one of
      the plus sides of the canoe - as opposed to a kayak - is that it sits much
      lower in the water and is thus less affected by the wind. This does make
      it a slower craft, but at least during the yearly trips down the Delaware
      with my extended family, the river has a lot of impact on how fast the
      boat goes. It's kind of funny, actually: it wasn't until we started using
      the canoe to get across the lake that you realize how slow the canoe
      really is.] We did get there, and we promptly started to build a fire to
      make breakfast.


      We toasted bagels and topped them with our preferred spreads.\[7. Cream
      cheese for me, peanut butter for Heidi.] We also brought a percolator,
      which my mom informed me was actually for making espresso, to make coffee,
      though we couldn't use it this morning for lack of a fire. However, it did
      produce delightfully strong coffee after we figured out how to position it
      in the fire to boil.


      We subsequently spent much of the afternoon, quite frankly, lounging
      around the campsite and reading. Heidi went for a swim at one point, but
      we felt content to take it easy for most of the day, as we were planning
      on the difficult hike up Blue Mountain that we go on every year. I made a
      sandwich for lunch.


      **I never finished writing this. Sorry!**
