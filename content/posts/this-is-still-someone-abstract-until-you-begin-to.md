Most educators and students don\x92t know what it\x92s like to forge connections with people youve never met. For me, face to face interactions for many of my professional colleagues supplement my online interactions. The notion of digital dualism is largely the crux of what holds education back from valuing these connections. This doesn\x92t suggest we can\x92t discuss manners and norms but it also can\x92t be shrouded with superiority or nostaligia. Those two perspectives will always remain so long as folks only see their connections as supplement or a second choice.\n</ExtendedQuote>\n\nThe idea that the \x91offline\x92 is more authentic than online is a major barrier for the use of technology and social media in the classroom. \_For those of us who use those technologies to connect with people every day, those connections feel just as \x91real\x92 as offline connections. \_They\x92re not less meaningful unless you fail to cultivate meaning from them.\n"
