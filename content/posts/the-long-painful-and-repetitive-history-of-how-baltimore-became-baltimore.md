      Even if we lived in a post-racial society (lol), we still have to grapple
      with and undo centuries of discriminatory and oppressive practices. This
      is what racism looks like. It's not angry white men screaming the n-word;
      it's historical redlining turning into modern-day predatory lending, all
      of which results in a large number of minority Americans concentrated in
      poverty-stricken areas. Areas which are more heavily monitored by police
      who view everyone with suspicion.


      You don't even necessarily *need* police officers to hate them; they just
      need to dehumanize them enough so they don't care about their victims pain
      when their spine snaps.


      This is how White Supremacy perpetuates itself. It's just as much in
      things you see as in things you don't.
