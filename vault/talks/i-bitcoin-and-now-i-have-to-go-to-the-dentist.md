# I Bitcoin and Now I Have to Go to the Dentist

---

## Who are we?

James DiGioia - Front-End Developer

Daryl Keeter - Front-End Developer

---

## Disclosures

James - ~$100 in bitcoin currently

Daryl - ~$850 in bitcoin currently

---

## Agenda

- What is the blockchain?
- What is bitcoin?
- Enthusiast perspective
- Skeptic perspective

---

## What is the blockchain?

- A public ledger
  - Records or transactional data (blocks)
- Decentralized
  - No centralized control of the ledger
- Distributed
  - No single point of failure

## What is blockchain used for?

- Smart Contracts
  - Execute when conditions are met
- Governance
  - Record voting and election data
- Identity management
  - Identity and ownership
- Peer-to-Peer digital payments
  - Bitcoin

---

## So....

### what is bitcoin then?

---

## Blockchain is a distributed ledger

Bitcoin is a currency built on top of this ledger

---

## Individuals have wallets on Bitcoin's blockchain

This validates that a user controls a particular account on the ledger

- Think private key vs public key
- Private key - wallet itself
- Public key - wallet address

---

## When I want to send money to a wallet address,

the software bundles that transaction with other transactions into a block.

The network validates the block, cryptographically linking it to the previous block.

---

## Every transaction has to be validated by the network

---

## So where does bitcoin come from?

---

TODO IMAGE

<!-- ![Miners](src/@talks/prezis/i-bitcoin-and-now-i-have-to-go-to-the-dentist/miners.jpg) -->

---

- Miners are computers that compute the cryptographic link between blocks
- Network validates that the result is correct
- Once network validates, block is added to the chain

---

## Miners are rewarded with a bitcoin for this computation

---

---

## The difficulty calculating this link is what limits the number of bitcoin

The Bitcoin network has a hard cap on number of bitcoin that can be mined

This scarcity is what gives them their value

---

## Blockchain, the good

---

- Immutable History
  - What goes in the blockchain, stays in the blockchain
- Transparent History
  - Auditable. Anyone can view at any time
- Secure
  - Cryptographically and architecturally
- It's only the beginning!

---

## Bitcoin, the good

---

- Users are anonymous
  - No personal data needed for transfer. No taxes.
- No third party involvement
  - No banks. Transactions/accounts can't be frozen.
- Send/Receive worldwide
- Benefits for merchants
  - No reversals. No limits.

---

## The Skeptic Perspective

### Blockchain & Bitcoin is not a revolution

---

## Blockchain

- Blockchain hasn't proven to be useful outside of "currency"
- Computing new blocks on the Blockchain is expensive
- For many use cases, distributed isn't a feature

---

## Bitcoin

- Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a commodity
- Bitcoin & cryptocurrencies are currently in a bubble
- A unregulated market is a bug, not a feature

---

> Bitcoin was supposed to demonstrate the power of a true free market... it's full of scams, rent-seekers, theft, useless for real purchases and accelerates climate change. Mission accomplished.

> — Adam Chalmers

---

## Bitcoin is a technological solution to a political problem, and is emblematic of Silicon Valley's disinterest in doing the hard work of politics.

## Thank You

Any questions?
