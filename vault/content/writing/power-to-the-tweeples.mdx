description: |
  I had a brief conversation with Matthew Ingram of GigaOm, in which I disagreed as to whether or not Twitter is a media company. But the debate is more interesting than that.

Last Friday I had an interesting, albeit brief, Twitter conversation with Matthew Ingram of GigaOm. Ingram has long argued that [Twitter is a media company](http://gigaom.com/2012/01/31/sorry-dick-but-twitter-is-definitely-a-media-entity), and [his story from Friday](http://paidcontent.org/2013/05/10/news-flash-twitter-doesnt-have-to-hire-journalists-to-be-a-powerful-media-competitor/) continued that line of thought. I took issue with the metaphor and the characterization of Twitter as a media company.
