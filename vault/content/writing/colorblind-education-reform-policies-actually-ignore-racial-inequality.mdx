I'll be honest, before I knew any better, I belonged to the "John Roberts School of Fighting Racism": "The best way to stop discriminating based on race is to stop discriminating based on race." However, it's the outcomes of these policies (and personal practices) that's often discriminatory. We can't simply ignore it and expect it to go away on its own.
