This is interesting, though it doesn't square with my observations of it. It's worth noting that the study doesn't separate out e-cig users who turn to it as a method of quitting smoking, just users in general. I know at least one friend for whom that was never his intention, so obviously it doesn't look like it helps people quit if you look at it that way.
