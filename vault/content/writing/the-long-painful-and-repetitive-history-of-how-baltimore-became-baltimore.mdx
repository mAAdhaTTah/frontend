Even if we lived in a post-racial society (lol), we still have to grapple with and undo centuries of discriminatory and oppressive practices. This is what racism looks like. It's not angry white men screaming the n-word; it's historical redlining turning into modern-day predatory lending, all of which results in a large number of minority Americans concentrated in poverty-stricken areas. Areas which are more heavily monitored by police who view everyone with suspicion.

You don't even necessarily *need* police officers to hate them; they just need to dehumanize them enough so they don't care about their victims pain when their spine snaps.

This is how White Supremacy perpetuates itself. It's just as much in things you see as in things you don't.
