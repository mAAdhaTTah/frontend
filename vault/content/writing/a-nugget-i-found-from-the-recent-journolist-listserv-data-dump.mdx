[Ryan Donmoyer from the "Journolist Listserv"](http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/716753/journolist.txt):

> The World Cup is a lot like the Senate. All they do is kick the ball around but nothing ever happens and no one who watches knows what the hell is going on.

Update: Ryan Donmoyer contacted me on Twitter about it and was kind enough to search for the original thread. This quote cannot be attributed to him:
