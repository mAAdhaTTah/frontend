Headline: ["Snowden journalist to publish UK secrets after Britain detains partner"](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/19/us-usa-security-snowden-brazil-idUSBRE97I0LZ20130819)

Lede:

> The journalist who first published secrets leaked by fugitive former U.S. intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden vowed on Monday to publish more documents and said Britain will be "sorry" for detaining his partner for nine hours.

[Greenwald's quote](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rm09tf):

> Q: Will the UK's detention of your partner deter your future reporting?
>
> A: Absolutely not. If anything, it will do the opposite. It will embolden me: I have many more documents to report on, including ones about the UK, where I'll now focus more. I will be more aggressive, not less, in reporting.
>
> Q: What effect do you think they'll be of the UK's detention of your partner?
>
> A: When they do things like this, they show the world their real character. It'll backfire. I think they'll come to regret it.

Well, it's definitely sensationalized, but from his quote, it does sound like he's going to go after the UK harder. The part about them being sorry is obviously misleading because they're not going to be sorry because of his leaks, but he is saying he will focus on them more now.
