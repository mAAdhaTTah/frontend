title: A eulogy for my grandmother
description: |

> We shared a number of half-remembered family reunions with this fun-loving Irish family. And grandma was no slouch either.
>
> I'll always remember her as the trunk of this large family tree. 5 kids, 10 grandkids, plus significant others. And grandparents on both sides of my family lived to see their great-grandkids, too. We have a lot of family to share this time with. She was always so proud.
>
> Proud of the legacy she's leaving behind.
>
> Proud of the family she started.
>
> Proud of the children she raised. Proud of all of us.
>
> And that's how I'll remember her. The Irish Matriarch. The White Queen. The one who always took her perfect Manhattans with ice, because, as she said, "the drink lasts longer, and so do I."
>
> She lived to be 92, so who knows? Maybe it was the ice.
>
> Goodbye Grandma. You lived a long and fruitful life, and we're all going to miss you.
