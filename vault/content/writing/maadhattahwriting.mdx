Today, I'm starting a new experiment; I've been working on a plugin called [WordPress-GitHub Sync](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-github-sync), which exports my WordPress posts to markdown on GitHub, as well as imports those posts if I make changes there. You can see the plugin at the link below.

It's *probably* ready for production, but I'm running it as a beta on my site over the next week to make sure. Definitely interested in getting some feedback, and it'll probably be going up on WordPress.org next weekend.

This also means you can fork and open pull requests against my writing. See a typo? Find a sentence that doesn't make a lot of sense? Got an idea you'd like to expand on? I'd love to get your input!
