[Larry Cuban, "Are There Lessons from the History of School Reform?"](http://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/are-there-lessons-from-the-history-of-school-reform/):

> The current crop of school reformers have a full agenda of Common Core standards, test-driven accountability, expanding parental choice through charters and vouchers, spreading virtual teaching and learning, and ridding classrooms of ineffective teachers based upon students' test scores. These reformers have their eyes fixed on the future not the horrid present where schools, in their charitable view, are dinosaurs. These reformers are allergic to the history of school reform; they are ahistorical activists that carry the whiff of arrogance associated with the uninformed.

Interesting to note that edreformers suffer from the same lack of historical perspective as the Silicon Valley hype machine.
