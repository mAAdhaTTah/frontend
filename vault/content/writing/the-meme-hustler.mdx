Evgeny Morozov, of 'The Net Delusion' and 'To Save Everything, Click Here' fame, [takes on Tim O'Reilly](http://thebaffler.com/past/the_meme_hustler "The Meme Hustler") as the poster child for Silicon Valley's transformation of language and the loss of complexity it engenders:

> While the brightest minds of Silicon Valley are "disrupting" whatever industry is too crippled to fend off their advances, something odd is happening to our language. Old, trusted words no longer mean what they used to mean; often, they don't mean anything at all. Our language, much like everything these days, has been hacked. Fuzzy, contentious, and complex ideas have been stripped of their subversive connotations and replaced by cleaner, shinier, and emptier alternatives; long-running debates about politics, rights, and freedoms have been recast in the seemingly natural language of economics, innovation, and efficiency. Complexity, as it turns out, is not particularly viral.
