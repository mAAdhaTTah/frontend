# Second Brain or Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

A Second Brain or PKM is a method of organizing information to support you in developing ideas & writing. I use it to better represent & connect my ideas & thinking in a way that feels reflective of how my brain works. I'm a Software Engineering, so everything in my PKM is extremely structured. I define types by the structure of the metadata on those markdown files and (sometimes) how the content relates to the content type. I can then compose these types together to express what a particular note represents.

## Design

I have a lot of different note types because I imported a bunch of data from a bunch of different sources into the vault. This includes things like Pinboard and my contacts & LinkedIn connections (which I ironically pulled in by testing a different program then exporting my data before pulling the plug). As a result, I have a *lot* of different note types representing all the different object types I've imported into this system. With the expressive power of Obsidian, DataView, and other plugins, you can build little apps on top of these notes, making it a really powerful tool.

### Categorization

Each note falls into a different category, represented as a folder, which is loosely modeled on Nick Milo's ACE System and Tiago Forte's PARA method. Additionally, I have a category for apps, although I may fold that into the Atlas category in the future.

Those categories are:

* **Inbox** (`@inbox`): Where new notes come in to be filed
* **Apps** (`+01apps`): Collections of notes that make up the data of an app
* **Atlas** (`+02atlas`): Notes that focus on knowledge
* **Calendar** (`+03calendar`): Notes that focus on a period of time or moment
* **Efforts** (`+04efforts`): Notes that make up project or area of work
* **Archive** (`+05archive`): Notes of complete projects

The leading numbers & symbols keeps the folders sorted in the above order. I also have a `home` note and an `excalibrain` note which I use for navigating my notes.

### Note types

* Temporary notes to keep fleeting thoughts
* Notes on media & learning materials
* Notes that digest a Reference Notes
* Notes that document a concept or particular idea
* Entrypoint notes into broader concepts or areas
* Notes containing a review of a poker hand
* Notes of URL bookmarks
* Notes referencing a person
* Notes from interactions & conversations with people
* Note the represents a particular thought, experience, or explanation I gave at some point
* Note that represents some piece of content I want to publish
* Periodic notes
* Notes of projects & threads I'm working on
* Notes to organize an outreach to people
* An individual contact during an outreach
* Notes of things I've consumed

## Maintenance

Now that I have this imported, this is how I am [Processing my inbox](/writing/second-brain/processing-my-inbox).
I am also working on these Imported Notes.

## Evolution

What if everything was primarily foldered by type instead of category?

* ^ No worry about where everything goes
* ! Uglier

Maybe I switch to "folder by type" when everything is out of the Inbox folder, then I can import right into the right folder with the `#inbox` tag.
