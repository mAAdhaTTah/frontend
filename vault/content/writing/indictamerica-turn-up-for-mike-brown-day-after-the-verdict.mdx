I don't have anything to say that hasn't been said more eloquently by others, but if you're as upset and angry about last night's #Ferguson decision (and live in New York City), there's a protest tonight @ 7pm in Union Square. I'm going to try and make it, but if not, the least I can do is help spread the word.
