I think my favorite thing about Webassembly is the possibility of being able to write both the front- and back-end in a language other than JavaScript. Node is great, but sometimes it's not the right choice for a particular use case, and being able to choose a language other than JavaScript and still get the kind of isomorphism you get running a V8 instance on a server is amazing.

I also really want to use it as an opportunity to learn another language. If Rust can compile to Webassembly and work in the browser, I can learn Rust, and learn it easier because I can apply it in an area that I already have a lot of experience. I don't think I'm the only one for whom this is true, and I think that's awesome.
