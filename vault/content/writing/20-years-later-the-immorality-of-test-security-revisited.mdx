[Grant Wiggins , "20 years later: the immorality of test security, revisited"](http://grantwiggins.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/20-years-later-the-immorality-of-test-security-revisited/):

> As I have long written, I have no problem with the state doing a once-per-year audit of performance. But what far too many policy-makers and measurement wonks fail to understand is that if the core purpose of the test is to improve performance, not just audit it, then most test security undercuts the purpose. Look, I get the point of security: you can get at understanding far more easily and efficiently (hence, cheaply) if the student does not know the specific question that is coming; I'm ok with that. But complete test security after the fact serves only the test-makers: they get to re-use items (and do so with little oversight), and they make the entire test more of a superficial dipstick, using proxies for real work, than a genuine test of transparent and worthy performance.

This is really kind of a basic thing: tests are being used as audits, doling out rewards and punishments, rather than as a tool or method for helping teachers and schools improve.
