[Jaron Lanier on Edge.org, "DIGITAL MAOISM: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism"](http://www.edge.org/conversation/digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism):

I had strong disagreements with this piece until this part -- he spends much of it downplaying the power of crowds and algorithms, but I think at this moment, he moves from criticism to nuance, and gives the whole piece a lot more power. Long, but very fascinating.
