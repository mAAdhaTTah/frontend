Late last night, Politico published [an expose on Jill Abramson's "turbulent leadership" at the New York Times](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/new-york-times-turbulence-90544.html). Unfortunately, it appears the piece can be summed up like this: New York Times reporters don't like working for a woman.

The piece twists itself into knots, trying to figure out how to best criticize her work; Abramson, the woman who led the Times to win four Pulitzer's this year, established a paywall that has helped shore up the Times' digital revenue, embraced the web's technology with innovative pieces like "[Snow Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek)," and helped maintain this struggling newspaper as the "paper of record," is alternately "impossible" to work with but isn't around enough or "approachable;" alternately "very unpopular right now" and leaving the Times "leaderless" but still "very respected there."
