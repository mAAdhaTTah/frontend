# Writing

This is my writing garden. I publish some thoughts, including essays, concepts, interpretations, and other scraps. I try to keep this updated as I learn new things so I can share these pages as my thinking evolves.

I am building a [writing/second-brain](/vault/writing/second-brain.md) in [writing/obsidian](/vault/writing/obsidian.md) and publishing the knowledge I develop there on to the web. I'm a Software Engineer, which informs my second-brain-building, and you can find my thoughts on [writing/software-engineering](/vault/writing/software-engineering.md). I'm an organizer and write about Socialism & Politics.

In 2012, I took a trip to Thailand, which I wrote about in my [writing/thailand-journal](/vault/writing/thailand-journal.md).
