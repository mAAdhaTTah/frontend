# Notes that digest and link to Reference Notes

After I finish reading and creating Notes on media & learning materials, I sometimes create a separate note for interpreting those notes. As inspired by [How to Process Notes in Obsidian with the Readwise Official Obsidian Plugin](/vault/writing/how-to-process-notes-in-obsidian-readwise-official-obsidian-plugin.md):

> And after that, I take this further by creating another page, which is outside of Readwise. These are quotes that are directly from the author so they're in the author's words. But just to create that separation between what's my words and what somebody else's words, I usually like to create another note where I step back and look at it from, still from the perspective of the author but I'm trying to understand what he's trying to say.

The basic idea is to keep the raw material the author produced separate from my own thoughts or interpretations. I can also pull multiple ideas into separate notes, all tied to a single article, which can be later combined with other notes from other articles into my [Notes that document a concept or particular idea](/vault/writing/notes-that-document-a-concept-or-particular-idea.md).

To be honest, I don't necessarily write a ton of these right now. As I am [Processing my inbox](/vault/writing/processing-my-inbox.md), I have been mostly dropping my links into concept notes under a "References" heading, which I will integrate later after I get all my references in my inbox processed.
