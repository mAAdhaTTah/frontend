# Obsidian

> The free and flexible app for your private thoughts.

Obsidian sits at the center of my [[Second Brain]]. The reason I chose it over the other options is:

1. Future proofing: all of my data is in markdown files, so I don't require Obsidian to make use of them[^1].
2. Plugin ecosystem: Obsidian is very extensible, so I can easily install new functionality or build it myself if I need.

It took a few iterations to get to this place, but the [Design & Maintenance of my Second Brain](Design%20&%20Maintenance%20of%20my%20Second%20Brain.md) matches well with the way my engineer-brain thinks.
