# Obsidian

> The free and flexible app for your private thoughts.

Obsidian sits at the center of my [Second Brain](/vault/writing/second-brain.md). The reason I chose it over the other options is:

1. Future proofing: all of my data is in markdown files, so I don't require Obsidian to make use of them[^1].
2. Plugin ecosystem: Obsidian is very extensible, so I can easily install new functionality or build it myself if I need.

It took a few iterations to get to this place, but the [Design & Maintenance of my Second Brain](/vault/writing/design-maintenance-of-my-second-brain.md) matches well with the way my engineer-brain thinks.
