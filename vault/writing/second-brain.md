# Second Brain

A Second Brain is a method of organizing the contents of your head externally to help you make sense of & manage it. As the inventor of GTO David Allen said, "The mind is for having ideas, not holding them". My second brain is a collection of tools centered around [Obsidian](Obsidian.md) that I use to manage my life as inspired by Nick Milo's [ACE System](ACE%20System.md). The [Design & Maintenance of my Second Brain](Design%20&%20Maintenance%20of%20my%20Second%20Brain.md) went through several iterations, but has largely settled on a "type-based" system inspired by [anytype — the everything app](anytype%20%E2%80%94%20the%20everything%20app.md) & [Capacities – A studio for your mind](Capacities%20%E2%80%93%20A%20studio%20for%20your%20mind.md).

While Obsidian manages the core of each part of my system, there are also a few supporting tools I also use regularly:

- **Atlas**
  - [Devonthink](Devonthink.md) functions as a virtual filing cabinet for emails, PDFs, and other documents.
    - I can link to Devonthink from Obsidian with [ryanjamurphy/DEVONlink-obsidian](ryanjamurphyDEVONlink-obsidian%20Open%20notes%20indexed%20in%20DEVONthink%20in,%20well,%20DEVONthink.md), although I admittedly don't do this much.
    - I mostly use it to save my tax documents, receipts, etc.
  - I also integrate Obsidian with [marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue](marc0l92obsidian-jira-issue%20This%20plugin%20allows%20you%20to%20track%20the%20progress%20of%20Atlassian%20Jira%20issues%20from%20your%20Obsidian%20notes..md) to pull those into my notes.
    - This is really useful for 1:1s & meeting notes, connecting discussions back to the tickets we discussed.
- **Calendar**
  - Google Calendar alongside the [Obsidian Google Calendar Plugin](Obsidian%20Google%20Calendar%20Plugin.md).
    - I don't _love_ Google Calendar but it functions well enough.
    - I do love the calendar plugin though. I integrate it into my daily notes so I can look at my day while I'm journaling.
- **Efforts**
  - [Todoist](Todoist.md) manages my tasks & projects.
    - I originally spent some time trying to get the integrations to work to manifest Todoist projects in my Obsidian efforts but I never found them super useful. I don't generally feel the need to manage my tasks in Obsidian.
      - Obsidian's mobile load time is a major blocker to managing tasks in Obsidian. Todoist let's get from "I need to do this" to "this is in my inbox" way faster.
    - I don't do as much with JIRA as I used to, now that I'm a manager, but when I do, I just create the tickets as tasks in Todoist. I can then break down subtasks in Todoist if I need to do it in chunks.
      - The above plugin does let you manifest JIRA searches into your notes if you need to though.

The overall goal of this system is to enable [Reflection as a practice](Reflection%20as%20a%20practice.md).
