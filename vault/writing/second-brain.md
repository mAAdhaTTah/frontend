# Second Brain

A Second Brain is a method of organizing the contents of your head externally to help you make sense of & manage it. As the inventor of GTO David Allen said, "The mind is for having ideas, not holding them". My second brain is a collection of tools centered around [Obsidian](/vault/writing/obsidian.md) that I use to manage my life as inspired by Nick Milo's ACE System. The [Design & maintenance of my second brain](/vault/writing/design-maintenance-of-my-second-brain.md) went through several iterations, but has largely settled on a "type-based" system inspired by anytype — the everything app & Capacities – A studio for your mind.

While Obsidian manages the core of each part of my system, there are also a few supporting tools I also use regularly:

- **Atlas**
  - Devonthink functions as a virtual filing cabinet for emails, PDFs, and other documents.
    - I can link to Devonthink from Obsidian with ryanjamurphyDEVONlink-obsidian Open notes indexed in DEVONthink in, well, DEVONthink, although I admittedly don't do this much.
    - I mostly use it to save my tax documents, receipts, etc.
  - I also integrate Obsidian with marc0l92obsidian-jira-issue This plugin allows you to track the progress of Atlassian Jira issues from your Obsidian notes. to pull those into my notes.
    - This is really useful for 1:1s & meeting notes, connecting discussions back to the tickets we discussed.
- **Calendar**
  - Google Calendar alongside the [Obsidian Google Calendar Plugin](/vault/links/obsidian-google-calendar-plugin.md).
    - I don't _love_ Google Calendar but it functions well enough.
    - I do love the calendar plugin though. I integrate it into my daily notes so I can look at my day while I'm journaling.
- **Efforts**
  - Todoist manages my tasks & projects.
    - I originally spent some time trying to get the integrations to work to manifest Todoist projects in my Obsidian efforts but I never found them super useful. I don't generally feel the need to manage my tasks in Obsidian.
      - Obsidian's mobile load time is a major blocker to managing tasks in Obsidian. Todoist let's get from "I need to do this" to "this is in my inbox" way faster.
    - I don't do as much with JIRA as I used to, now that I'm a manager, but when I do, I just create the tickets as tasks in Todoist. I can then break down subtasks in Todoist if I need to do it in chunks.
      - The above plugin does let you manifest JIRA searches into your notes if you need to though.

The overall goal of this system is to enable Reflection as a practice.
