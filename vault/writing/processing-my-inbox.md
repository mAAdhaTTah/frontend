# Processing my inbox

I imported a lot of content into my Obsidian vault, so I needed a plan on how to nurture the core of vault while integrating the new content. One idea that I've adopted from [How to Process Notes in Obsidian with the Readwise Official Obsidian Plugin](/vault/writing/how-to-process-notes-in-obsidian-readwise-official-obsidian-plugin.md) is the split between [Notes that digest a reference note](/vault/writing/notes-that-digest-a-reference-note.md) (interpretation notes) and Notes on media & learning materials.
