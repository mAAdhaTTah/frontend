title: How to Process Notes in Obsidian // Readwise Official Obsidian Plugin
authors:
  - "[Nicole van der Hoeven](/vault/people/nicole-van-der-hoeven.md)"
summary: This video tutorial discusses how to process notes in Obsidian using the Readwise Official Obsidian plugin. The presenter explains that Readwise acts as a middle layer between the raw information and the distilled learnings in Obsidian. By using Readwise, users can sync their highlights and notes from various sources such as books, articles, tweets, and PDFs into their Obsidian vault. The video walks through the process of installing the Readwise plugin, connecting it to a Readwise account, and configuring the settings for importing and organizing the highlights in the Obsidian vault. The presenter also demonstrates how Readwise can be used to save and sync highlights from Kindle books and tweets, and how to further process and analyze the collected notes in Obsidian.

# How to Process Notes in Obsidian // Readwise Official Obsidian Plugin

## Notes

> Readwise acts a bit like middleware. You can think of it as this layer between the raw information and what you've learned out of that information that you probably keep in your Obsidian vault.

> Every day at 9:00 pm (I chose that, because that's a time that I personally feel the most alert in the entire day), I sit down and go through everything I've tagged or that Readwise has tagged with a TVZ tag. It can really be any tag that you want but that's what I use. And then I go through what I've highlighted and think about what ideas I can pull out of that.

> So the idea is that I'm now starting to step back and look at the book in general, and see what I can pick up from it rather than the specific passages.
> So this isn't about quotes, this is about my general thoughts of what the author was trying to say.

> And after that, I take this further by creating another page, which is outside of Readwise. These are quotes that are directly from the author so they're in the author's words. But just to create that separation between what's my words and what somebody else's words, I usually like to create another note where I step back and look at it from, still from the perspective of the author but I'm trying to understand what he's trying to say.

> I guess the question here is when do you stop? Because as you can see, I could just keep going here. You know, Kubedim led me to create this new page, on Kubedim that's in my words. And then that led me to create something on Circuit Breaker Pattern and Dimming. And I could go back to Site Reliability Engineering. And the answer is that it doesn't really have a clear end. And I think that's the point. I think it's very easy to get caught up in the cycle wanting to completely finish it, but it never actually finishes. So I don't really have a quantitative way of saying when you should stop processing. I think it's a much better idea to just go as deep as you feel like going, as deep as is relevant at the time that you create these notes and they're still going to be in the vault for later. So it's not like they're completely lost.
