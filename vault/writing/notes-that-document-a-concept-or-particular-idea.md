# Notes that document a concept or particular idea

These are like Evergreen Notes, but are typically larger than the clear and concise version Nick suggests. Concept notes tie together an idea, and often functions a bit as a catch-all when I don't have an obvious other note it should be. The more fleshed out notes can have multiple paragraphs, sections, tables, etc., while there are also just placeholders for an idea I want to explore later but don't have enough content for.

It does fulfill the other 3 criteria: own words, linked and non-static. Like concept notes, Evergreen Notes Are Things or Statements About Things, and often include some level of opinion or analysis of the information I'm taking in. Evergreen Notes Are Antifragile, and concept notes are created and linked to widely in other notes.
