# Reflection as a practice

The purpose of this system isn't just to be a repository of information or a messy filing cabinet of clippings but a space to actually consider what I'm doing and why. I have found that a lot of the ruminating I would normal was brain cycles on can be alleviated by writing down what I'm thinking. The act of reflection is often powerful enough to help unblock me and given me a clear path forward, or even just alleviate the anxiety & stress of a situation.

TODO: Connect the two references together through "reflection in a chaotic world". Attention is of limited supply.
