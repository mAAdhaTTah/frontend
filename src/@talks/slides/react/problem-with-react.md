### The Problem with React

`React | Streams === false`

Have to pass callbacks around your application

---

From the Redux docs:

```javascript
export default ({ props: { todos, dispatch } }) => {
  const boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators(TodoActionCreators, dispatch);

  return <TodoList todos={todos} {...boundActionCreators} />;
  // return <TodoList todos={todos} dispatch={dispatch} />
};
```

Note:

- Injected by react-redux
- Hereâ€™s a good use case for bindActionCreators:
  You want a child component to be completely unaware of Redux.
- An alternative to bindActionCreators is to pass
  just the dispatch function down, but then your child component
  needs to import action creators and know about them.
