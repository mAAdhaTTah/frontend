One of the things that came out of the [BatchYouTubeUploader](https://jamesdigioia.com/new-project-batchyoutubeuploader/) was this nifty little object class, [ParseCSV](https://github.com/jimeh/php-parsecsv), which I use to manipulate the CSV file for uploading the videos. I know it's going to find a lot of use, and in this case, I wrote this little script to loop through a CSV and download a bunch of images. Just note you have to have `allow_url_fopen` set to `true`, as per this [StackExchange](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724391/saving-image-from-php-url-using-php) post.
