[Conor Friedersdorf in The Atlantic, "Proving a Conservative Caricature of Boston Bombing Coverage Wrong"](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/proving-a-conservative-caricature-of-boston-bombing-coverage-wrong/275293/):

> Generally speaking, "mainstream" outlets have been diligently reporting out the story and gathering that evidence. The conservative press has done very little reporting. Its been busy cherry-picking liberal dissents from the jihadist theory of the Boston bombing, treating those dissents as if they're representative of "the liberal media" generally, and needlessly worrying about a supposed unwillingness to confront radical Islam. "The chances are that we will learn nothing important from Boston about the enduring terrorist threat against our country," Rich Lowry writes. "When the next attack comes, and it will, we will again scratch our heads and wonder who could do such a thing, and why?" I think he's been reading too much Steyn, and that when the next attack comes, the mainstream media will thoroughly report on the people behind it too.

Surprise, surprise -- conservatives live in a bubble.
