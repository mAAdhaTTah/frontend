[Maya Wiley for Salon, "Inside Our Racist Brains"](http://www.salon.com/2013/07/18/inside_george_zimmermans_brain/ "Inside Our Racist Brains"):

> Correll formed a video game-like experiment based on decades of "implicit associations" research. Participants had milliseconds to assess whether a person (or "target") on the screen was carrying a gun. If the person had a gun, the participant had to quickly push a button to "shoot" the person. If the person had something else, like a wallet or a cell phone, participants had to press a different button. Time and again, research subjects wrongly shot the unarmed Black "targets." And here is the kicker: Correll's findings held even when the research subjects were Black. In other words, even Black people are more likely to shoot unarmed Black targets than armed white targets.

Even if we're not consciously considering race in a situation, there's often something lurking beneath the surface. Accusing someone of "injecting race" into something is dumb, because race is already in *everything*.
