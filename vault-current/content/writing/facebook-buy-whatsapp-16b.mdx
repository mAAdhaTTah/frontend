> WhatsApp's numbers speak for themselves. The company has more than 450 million monthly active users on the platform, according to the company, with more than 70 percent of users returning to the app on a daily basis. The company has doubled in size over the past year, and sees more than half a billion photos sent over the service on a daily basis. Additionally, more than 200 million voice messages are sent on the service daily, along with more than 100 million videos sent.

I'm not sure what's crazier: the fact that Facebook is buying this company for \$16 billion or the fact that it might actually be worth it.
