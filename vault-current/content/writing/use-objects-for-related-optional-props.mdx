title: Use objects for related optional props

When you're building React components, you'll often end up in situations where you have an optional subcomponent that takes multiple props. The most common example is an image, which we'll explore below, but this can easily apply to links or other other configurable children. Let's take a look at this example, a problem with a common approach, and an elegant solution.

Let's say we're building a basic media component, which optionally displays an image if you provide one. You might start by writing it something like this:

!\[\[Objects for related optional props#^CardNaive-js]]

Great! Everything looks good, image is optional, ship it. "Wait!" Your intrepid coworker takes a look at this code and points out the `img` doesn't have an `alt` tag. That's bad for accessibility.

No problem, we can add an alt tag.

!\[\[Objects for related optional props#^add-alt-js]]

But this code has a problem: `imageAlt` isn't required if `imageSrc` is provided. You can still end up with an inaccessible image if another developer comes along and provides one with the other.

The basic problem is we have props that are related to each other that don't express that relationship via the props structure. Instead, we could explicitly express this relationship by providing `image` as an object:

!\[\[Objects for related optional props#^img-obj-prop-js]]
