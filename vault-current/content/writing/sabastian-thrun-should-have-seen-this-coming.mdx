[Betsy Corcoran for edSurge, "Udacity's Lessons Learned"](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-07-24-udacity-s-lessons-learned "Udacity's Lessons Learned"):

> That push helped in another way: initially many students were unaware of the online tutors (who are real people) who were available online to help, 12 hours a day. But over the weeks, it became clear that the tutoring services were crucial. "The mentoring program was absolutely essential for every student's outcome," Thrun says.
>
> Those tutors were so important because many students lacked even elementary-school-level mathematics knowledge, Thrun says. Among the frequently heard questions: How to divide two numbers? How can you subtract a bigger number from a smaller one? Tutors answered questions and continued to reach out to encourage students.
>
> As the class progressed, Udacity also realized that many of the students simply couldn't get to a computer regularly enough. For some students, says Thrun, "there were none in the home, \[and] even in school they couldn't get the hours needed to make progress. We had to work with the schools directly (to arrange for computer time for Udacity students.) It was actually a big deal."

Interesting to note how important human interaction is to making this online program work. Technology isn't going to revolutionize education if you need all these people to support it.

More importantly, though, if Thrun had spent more time in the real world, and less in the Valley, it would have been obvious that computer access would be a problem.
