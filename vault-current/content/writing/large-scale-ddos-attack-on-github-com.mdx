[Commenters on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9284226) are saying this is being done by China in order to get them to remove some software they don't like. Specifically, this organization, [Great Fire](https://github.com/greatfire), who develops software to get around the Great Firewall of China, and [this repo](https://github.com/cn-nytimes/mirrors) which provides a list of mirrors for the New York Times, which, as you probably know, is banned in China. This has been going on since Thursday, and I'm surprised I haven't seen more coverage for it elsewhere.
