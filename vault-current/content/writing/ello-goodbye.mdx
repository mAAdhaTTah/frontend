Some more interesting perspective on the impact venture capital is going to make on the future of Ello.

Edited to add: This is what I get for not reading the whole thing. The article itself actually suggests quitting Ello for taking venture capital, the point being that it's already been sold, and otherwise you are the ones creating its value for the eventual exit. Much more provocative than my initial post.
