[Kentaro Toyama in The Atlantic, "Dear Silicon Valley: Meritocracy Is an Ideology Too"](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/dear-silicon-valley-meritocracy-is-an-ideology-too/276756/):

> That's because the central political value that animates Silicon Valley is neither libertarianism nor progressivism. It's meritocracy. Meritocracy can appear to be socially liberal, because it doesn't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, politics, socio-economic background, sexual orientation, or nation of origin. And, meritocracy can look libertarian because it abhors anything – be it government, social convention, or four years of college – obstructing talent's rise to the top. And where do these forces intersect? In immigration reform, where the meritocratic impulse is to crush both nationalist and unionist opposition to importing high-end skill.
>
> But while meritocracy is a vast improvement over discrimination by traditional prejudices, it still privileges some people over others. And in Silicon Valley, privilege is heaped upon individualistic entrepreneurial capacity.

A good quick overview of the ideology of *meritocracy* and why it's not all it's cracked up to be.
