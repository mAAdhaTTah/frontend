Certainly as aspect I hadn't previously considered: the effect on those doing the shaming.

> I don’t see this backlash as problematic because I see the issue as no big deal, as some Noah apologists do. I see it as problematic because I see it as too big a deal to be funneled into putting just one guy on trial and giving the rest of the culture a pass—because “scapegoating,” in the classic sense of the term, is all about heaping symbolic abuse on a symbolic target to avoid having to actually change anything about ourselves.
