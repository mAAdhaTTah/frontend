[Leo Casey of Shanker Blog, "America's Union Suppression Movement (And Its Apologists), Part Two"](http://shankerblog.org/?p=8177):

> Similarly, in discussing teacher evaluations the Fordham/ERN report focuses entirely on matters of seniority layoffs, tenure and dismissal. There is no discussion of whether evaluations provide meaningful feedback and professional supports to teachers, thus improving the quality of teaching and learning across the board. The notion that tenure and due process could provide good teachers with the necessary protections to speak out when students are not being properly educated or are being unfairly treated is not even contemplated.

Shanker Blog does some great work, and this is a great criticism of a report put out by the Fordham Institute that basically started with a premise and wrapped the info around it. Good takedown.
