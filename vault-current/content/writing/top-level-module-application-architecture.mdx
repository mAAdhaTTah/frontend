When you start developing React applications, or JavaScript applications generally, it can be difficult to know how to organize your files. Dan Abramov's [sage advice](https://react-file-structure.surge.sh/), while accurate, doesn't tell you anything about whether what "feels right" is going to cause problems down the road. As I've worked with ESModules, I've started to develop an effective approach to developing modular JavaScript application in React. While you may not agree with all of the principles, you main find them useful for developing your own.

At core, this approach results in you treating every folder in your application like an npm module. Every folder directly under your application folder (typically `src`) is a module with a cohesive design & a defined set of exports. This lends itself to developing a consistent and maintainable organizational architecture that can evolve with your application and limiting the confusion from lots of deeply-nested, cross-module imports.

In order to maintain a consistent organizational structure, we need a set of principles to build on. I only recently fully understood the principles I was operating under recently, when I was asked to document my approach for my team. None of the principles are particularly original but combining them together and enforcing them strictly has worked pretty well for me. I call this collection of principles "Top-Level Modules" (TLM), because it needs a name and naming things is hard.

## Principles of Top-Level Modules

### Folders directly nested in your application folder are "modules"

A "module" is a folder at the top-level of your application folder, typically `src`, with a barrel defining its API. These are the top-level modules that come together to organize your application.

### Every module defines its exports in a barrel

A "barrel" is an `index.js` file that re-exports from other module files, rolling them up so they can be imported from a single location. Modules use barrels to define and enforce module boundaries.

Let's take a look at an example module.

!\[\[Top-Level Modules#^index-js]]

This is a hypothetical `widget` module, which provides a `Widget` type, some API methods for interacting with with widgets, and a schema for enforcing types. This is a coherent module with a well-defined API, and it enables you to create a `util.js` file if you have shared logic between these three files that you don't want to expose to the rest of the application.

Note that for now, Webpack doesn't require the `.js` extension, and Node also doesn't for Commonjs modules, but the ES Module implementation in Node will require it.

### Other modules must import through a barrel

Top-Level Modules enforces this boundary between modules. In a React application, you might have a component to display once of these widgets so customers can buy it. Let's take a look at how that component might use the `widget` module.

!\[\[Top-Level Modules#^WidgetView-jsx]]

This is a small dumb component that takes advantage of the `widget` module. We always import directly from the barrel instead of through `widget/api.js` or another folder.

### Modules must be pure

In all of the above example, the modules are pure definitions of exports; even the barrel. Your entrypoints will import whatever they need to bootstrap the application and tie everything together, and everything outside of those entrypoints should be pure, as much as that's possible. This has been mostly doable with the React applications I've built, with Create React App using `src/index.js` as its entrypoint or Next.js defining your routing in `pages`.

### Modules must be cohesive

What counts as "cohesive" here up is up for interpretation, but we'll talk about that more in the next section. The overall idea is that

## Module Organization Approaches

There are a couple possible strategies you can take to folder structures.

### Modules by type

Modules grouped by type, "components, reducers, etc.". Can be namespaced by `@app`.

### Modules by domain/concern

Modules grouped by business logic they own.

### Namespace of modules

Modules of a similar type namespaced. All of the modules that contain components nested under `@ui`, etc.

### Layered namespaces

Enforce that a namespace only depends on namespaces below them, or that a given namespace is layered in that way.
