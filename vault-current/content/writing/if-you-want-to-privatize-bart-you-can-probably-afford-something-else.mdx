The BART strikes are in full swing, and the reaction from the locals highlights striking differences in how different socio-economic status groups treat public services. Given its location in San Francisco, you would expect to see a outpouring of indignation from the tech industry, and you'd be right: PandoDaily has this [amusingly myopic piece from writer Sarah Lacey](http://pandodaily.com/2013/07/02/and-you-thought-sf-cabs-were-bad-bart-strike-is-crippling-fledgling-mid-market-tech-corridor/) (hat-tip to ValleyWag [for pointing this one out](http://valleywag.gawker.com/sarah-lacy-is-a-free-market-monster-701255630)), which ends with this money quote:

> I'll say this: The last few days have been a rare opportunity for cab drivers to shine. Every cab I've taken has been [impeccably clean, accepted credit cards with no grousing, and the drivers have been incredibly polite](http://pandodaily.com/2013/05/28/together-we-can-eradicate-taxis/). Although they all hate the scourge of Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar, the result of those services coming into the market is what's made my commute to and from work bearable this week. Competition, it turns out, does indeed make everyone better. It's too bad no one is working on disrupting BART.

Because "everyone" is really just people who can afford a taxi.
