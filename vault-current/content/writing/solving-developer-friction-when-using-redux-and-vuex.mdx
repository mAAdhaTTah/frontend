I've used Redux on a couple of small- to medium-sized applications, and while its been the inspiration for other solutions, it's got its own flaws and issues. I'm always interested in seeing what other methods of solving this problem are out there. I'm working on a [Vue.js](vuejs.org) application, so it made sense to try out the state management solution blessed by the developers behind the library.

The documentation for Vuex is solid, and it's been easy to understand what the library is doing. Because it's tied to Vue.js, the documentation provides a suggested application structure. The suggested application structure wraps pieces by "types", which is common (see Rails, Laravel, etc.). While I still favor that structure, the Redux community has been looking seriously at the ["Ducks"](https://medium.com/@scbarrus/the-ducks-file-structure-for-redux-d63c41b7035c) pattern. Vuex adopts parts of the Ducks pattern with `modules`, self-contained functions that manage subsection of the state.

The issue I have with that pattern is it ties actions to the effect it produces. You write a button and pass down a callback that dispatches `SAVE_USER`, which triggers the API call to the save the user's data. When a single action needs to trigger a sequence of side effects, `redux-thunk` allows a callback to wrap the entire sequence or `redux-promise` to dispatch Promises as action. Both of these solutions essentially couple the DOM events to the side effects they produce.

A Vuex application **can** avoid this problem through the use of a container component, the same way `react-redux` uses container components, but this isn't how Vuex works by default, and a lot of intermediate wiring is required to make that work. When a Vuex application boots, all the components have the store provided to them, encouraging components to speak directly into the store.

You have to do a lot of work to keep from getting components too entangled with the store, reducing their reusability. `react-redux` solves this by using `connect` to define container components, selecting the component's state from the store. This keeps the rest of the application from knowing anything about it and keeping it cleanly separated and reusable.

Using modules to make the application fractal is great feature. I also love the way Cycle.js fractalizes its design (functions all the way down!). With Vuex, though, the benefit is the way it ties the actions to state changes, like Redux's reducers.

The problem I have with both of these setups is it ultimately ties actions to their effects. Either you're calling into the store from your Vue component or you're threading callbacks through your React components. A component low in the hierarchy gets passed its action dispatch / side effecting functions through several layers, with intermediate layers passing along callbacks it doesn't need. [`brookjs`](https://valtech-nyc.github.io/brookjs/) forces components to be a stream of actions, encouraging them to decouple from the state changes they trigger. Component events emit actions, and Redux reducers respond to those events, the inverse of what Vuex encourages.

In `brookjs`, as you compose components together, you map actions from their generic children events to more specific events based on the component's context. This eliminates the need to thread callbacks down the way you do in React, allowing you to fully understand the component and its context without needing to know what callbacks the parent passes into it.

Each part of the application merely emits events when something inside of that section happens. They never emit events indicating what they want to have happen. It's up to other parts of the application to respond to those events appropriately.

The reducer doesn't need to know where the actions come from, and the components don't have to know what the action does. This makes actions themselves reusable as well, as they're the intermediary between those two parts of the application. We handle side effects by responding to these actions directly in other parts of the application. This encourages actions to represent their source, and makes actions more reusable as a result.

Does this make sense? Have you run into the problem using React or Vue?

***

*Addendum:* I've been looking at [redux-loop](https://github.com/redux-loop/redux-loop). I like the idea of the reducer being responsible for dispatching the action that indicates the side effect, or even using `Cmd.run` to bootstrap a new delta. This would have the result of putting more of the business logic of the application into the reducer.
