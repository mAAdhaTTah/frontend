I generally really like Matt Di Carlo and the Shanker Blog. They do a good job of explaining a lot of the problematic math behind test-based accountability. However, even from the "moderates" in this debate, the thing missing are the actual *kids*. Nowhere in the discussion is whether it's worthwhile for kindergarteners to spend their time TAKING A TEST (and all the test prep that goes along with it).
