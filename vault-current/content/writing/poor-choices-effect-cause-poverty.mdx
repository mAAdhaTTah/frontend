Interesting [review of a new study in The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/23/scarcity-sendhil-mullainathan-eldar-shafir). Basically, it appears we've basically gotten the cause and effect wrong when it comes to poverty:

> Behind every coalition promise to "get tough on single mothers", behind every Daily Mail story about Britain's "handout culture", or Mitt Romney's [notorious comments about "the 47%"](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser), there lies an assumption: that being poor is a failure of character. Awkwardly, for those who find this obnoxious, the research sometimes makes it seem true. People who are less well-off really do appear to give in more [readily to temptation](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/environment-energy/89377/poverty-escape-psychology-self-control), making the very purchases they can't afford; to make unwise financial decisions; to use [less effective parenting techniques](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=194928); or to fail to take life-saving drugs, even when they're free. Is this a deep-seated weakness of will, made worse by a "culture of dependency"? The Harvard economist Sendhil Mullainathan and the Princeton psychologist Eldar Shafir reject that idea, and some of the most familiar leftwing responses, too. Poverty, they argue, is indeed a matter of willpower and bad decisions, but the Mail has it back-to-front. It's not that foolish choices make you poor; **it's that poverty's effects on the mind lead to bad choices**. Living with too little imposes huge psychic costs, reducing our mental bandwidth and distorting our decisionmaking in ways that dig us deeper into a bad situation.

\[Emphasis mine]

Some of the ideas presented towards the end of the article are interesting in a kind of lifehack-y way: basically try and structure some aspects of society so that the "good" choices are easier to make than the bad ones.\[1. They called them "nudges."] Things like "Keep the Change" cards or Wells Fargo's credit card that helps pay down your mortgage, and generally making these types of programs opt-out, because so many people stick with the default.

This theory also gives credence to a lot of progressive thought regarding the need for the safety net. If poor people are less overwhelmed with their poverty, they'll have the mental bandwidth to make better choices and create (in theory) more of the virtuous circle required to help pull themselves out.
