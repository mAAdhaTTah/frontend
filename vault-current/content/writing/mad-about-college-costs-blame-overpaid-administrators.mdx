\[John Hechinger in Bloomberg, "Bureaucrats Paid $250,000 Feed Outcry Over College Costs"](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-14/bureaucrats-paid-250-000-feed-outcry-over-college-costs.html "Bureaucrats Paid $250,000 Feed Outcry Over College Costs")

> Administrative costs on college campuses are soaring, crowding out instruction at a time of skyrocketing tuition and \$1 trillion in outstanding student loans. At Purdue and other U.S. college campuses, bureaucratic growth is pitting professors against administrators and sparking complaints that tight budgets could be spent more efficiently.

Those who argue for MOOCs always act like the problem with costs is the fault of overpaid professors, but I'm pretty convinced (not based on this article alone, of course) that the problem has a lot to do with an excess of overpaid administrators.
