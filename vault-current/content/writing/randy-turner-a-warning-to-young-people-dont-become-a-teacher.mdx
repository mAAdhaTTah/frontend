[Randy Turner in the Huffington Post, "A Warning to Young People: Don't Become a Teacher"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/randy-turner/a-warning-to-young-people_b_3033304.html):

> Young teachers from across the United States have told me they no longer have the ability to properly manage classrooms, not because of lack of training, not because of lack of ability, not because of lack of desire, but because of upper administration decisions to reduce statistics on classroom referrals and in-school and out-of-school suspensions. As any classroom teacher can tell you, when the students know there will be no repercussions for their actions, there will be no change in their behavior. When there is no change in their behavior, other students will have a more difficult time learning.

We really very often make the mistake of not listening to those who are most impacted by our statements and policies. (viaÂ [edukaition](http://edukaition.tumblr.com/))
