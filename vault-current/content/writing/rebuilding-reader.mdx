> When Google declared war on RSS and the open web by killing off their reader it was a heavy blow for deep thinking and for blogging. At first, I didn't miss it. I still had twitter after all. But over time, I began to realize that relying on twitter only for what I was going to read and learn was like relying on the remote control of my TV.

Every once in a while, I consider dropping my RSS reader in favor of Twitter all the time. This article sums up why I don't.
