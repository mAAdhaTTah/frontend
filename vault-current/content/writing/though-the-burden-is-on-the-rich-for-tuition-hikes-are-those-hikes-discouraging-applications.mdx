From Matt Bruenig for Demos, ["Who Pays When the Cost of Public College Increases?"](http://www.demos.org/blog/8/15/13/who-pays-when-cost-public-college-increases):

> So from 1992 to 2007, four year public colleges dealt with cost increases by heavily dumping them on the upper half of the income distribution, while sparing the poorest quarter of students almost entirely. The rich students saw their costs increase by 11x more than the poorest quarter of students measured in dollar terms, and 7x more measured by percentage points. As of 2007, the poorest quarter of students were paying just 55.7 percent of what the richest quarter of students were paying to attend public four-year colleges.

This is interesting -- it's good to see some breakdown of this, because it's not obvious how the increase in tuition is affecting different groups. However, what's not included in this is how the increase in price affects which schools each group applies to and attends. Poor people who see the tuitions for even mid-tier colleges rise may be less likely to even apply to those schools. Inside Higher Ed reviewed a [report from Georgetown](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/31/report-documents-how-higher-education-exacerbates-racial-inequities) that highlighted how most new enrollments from minority and low SES households go to "open access" schools and exacerbate inequality. I wouldn't be surprised if this was affected by the rising price of higher ed.
