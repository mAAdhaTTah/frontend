Marc Scott of Coding 2 Learn:

> A teacher phones my office, complaining that his laptop has "no internet". I take a walk down to his classroom. He tells me that the internet was there yesterday, but today it's gone. His desktop is a solid wall of randomly placed Microsoft office icons. I quickly try and explain that the desktop is not a good place to store files as they're not backed up on the server, but he doesn't care; he just wants the internet back. I open the start menu and click on Internet Explorer, and it flashes to life with his homepage displayed. He explains that the Internet used to be on his desktop, but isn't any more. I close I.E. and scour the desktop, eventually finding the little blue 'e' buried amongst some PowerPoint and Excel icons. I point to it. He points to a different location on the screen, informing me of where it used to be. I drag the icon back to it's original location. He's happy. He can't use a computer.

This one made me laugh the most, mostly because "storing files on your desktop" is such a classic practice it no longer surprises me. However, the article itself is pretty serious. There is a lot said about kids as "digital natives," but it's all a myth. Kids don't know how to actually *use* computers any better than we do. They may be more comfortable with some internet applications, and they certainly have different interests and use cases, but in terms of how a computer (and the internet) actually *works*, they're no better than anyone else.

I mention this in light of the revelations coming out about the NSA (and generally a lot of the terrible laws that come out of Congress regarding the internet). These are the people who are going to grow up and continue making laws about these things, without any decent understanding of how they actually work.

On some level, we can forgive our current Congress for not understanding something this new, as they have a lot of things to deal with, and being up to date on the latest technology isn't always the highest priority. However, if those kids grow up into legislators and *still* don't know how computers work (like, actually *work*), then we've failed.
